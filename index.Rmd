# Welcome {-}

Hello <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/casa/"><img src="general_images/casa_logo.jpg" width="120" alt="CASA0023 course" align="right" style="margin: 0 1em 0 1em" /></a> and welcome to the Term 2 module Remotely Sensing Cities and Environments.


Similarly, to my Term 1 MSc module, CASA0005, this website holds all the practical instructions for the module. [CASA0005 Geographic Information Systems and Science](https://andrewmaclachlan.github.io/CASA0005repo/) is a pre-requisite of the module so concepts taught there will mainly be assumed here.
