  abstract = {Four time-sequential Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of an area of Amazon forest, pasture, and second growth near Manaus, Brazil were classified according to dominant ground cover, using a new technique based on fractions of spectral endmembers. A simple four-endmember model consisting of reflectance spectra of green vegetation, nonphotosynthetic vegetation, soil, and shade was applied to all four images. Fractions of endmembers were used to define seven categories, each of which consisted of one or more classes of ground cover, where class names were based on field observations. Endmember fractions varied over time for many pixels, reflecting processes operating on the ground such as felling of forest, or regrowth of vegetation in previously cleared areas. Changes in classes over time were used to establish superclasses which grouped pixels having common histories. Sources of classification error were evaluated, including system noise, endmember variability, and low spectral contrast. Field work during each of the four years showed consistently high accuracy in per-image classification. Classification accuracy in any one year was improved by considering the multiyear context. Although the method was tested in the Amazon basin, the results suggest that endmember classification may be generally useful for comparing multispectral images in space and time.},

  abstract = {Global evidence posits that we are on the cusp of fire-driven ‘tipping points' in some of the world's most important woody biomes including savannah woodlands, temperate forests, and boreal forests, with consequences of major changes in species dominance and vegetation type. The evidence also suggests that mega-fires are positive feedbacks to changing climates via carbon emissions, and will be responsible for large swings in water yield and quality from temperate forests at the regional scale. Two factors widely considered to have contributed to our current proximity to tipping points are changing climates and human management – the latter most obviously taking the form of allowing fuels to build up, either through policies of fire suppression or failure to implement sufficient fuel reduction fires – to the point where wildfire intensity increases dramatically. Much of the evidence comes from Australia and the USA, but domains such as Africa and the boreal north provide additional insights. Forests adapted to regimes of low-moderate intensity fires may not face the same challenges as the iconic ash forests of Australia and the coniferous forests of Yellowstone or the west coast of the USA that are adapted to high intensity fire. However the often modest physical barriers (including distance, topography and climate) between forests adapted to more frequent, low-moderate intensity fires on the one hand, and less frequent, high intensity fires on the other, are easily overcome by confluences of continually increasing fuel loads and changing climates that serve to increase both fire frequency and intensity. For temperate forests, we can mitigate the extent of large-scale, high intensity fires and their consequences if we carefully use fuel reduction fires and other standard forest management practises such as thinning. Mitigation will require assessing impacts on biodiversity of smaller, low-intensity fires at intervals of 5–10 years (to reduce fuels and mitigate fire size and intensity), against those of large-scale, high intensity wildfires at increasing (but unknown) frequency. Mitigation will require that forests be managed contiguously, not via different agencies with different objectives according to land tenure. Managing requires that governments and the communities they serve acknowledge the limitations of fire-suppression. Mitigating the incidence and effects of large-scale, high intensity fires through embracing the use of managed fire in conjunction with judicious use of fire suppression offers opportunity to avoid potentially large changes in vegetation and biomass (e.g. abundance of dominant species, biodiversity, fuel structure and loads), as well as in water yield and quality and carbon carrying capacity.},

However, the pattern of the relationship between vegetation cover and urban temperature can be masked, controlled or exaggerated by vegetation structure, topography and other climate variables. This study examines the relationship between Sydney's urban surface temperature and vegetation cover as defined by two vegetation indices; mixed vegetation cover and tree cover exclusively. The shape of this relationship and relative influence of confounding factors are explored using penalised-likelihood criteria ranked regressions. Overall, increasing tree cover reduces average surface temperatures more dramatically than mixed vegetation cover. This study demonstrates that the extent of influence of greencover on surface temperatures is more accurately defined by identifying and incorporating site specific factors that confound the influence. Best predictor models are significantly improved when the influences of elevation, coastal effects and urban structure are added. Therefore, heat reducing urban greening strategies will be improved if based on local variables and conditions.},

  abstract = {There is limited information available on the status of and threats to mangroves in developing countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In the recent years, there has been a significant increase in scientific and volunteer surveys. However, this information is usually not well integrated with information on human activities that have the potential to contribute to the degradation of these ecosystems. A project "Coastal Habitats at Risk" is being developed jointly by the United Nations University (UNU) and the World Resources Institute, and in partnership with UNESCO and the International Society for Mangrove Ecosystems (ISME), in an effort to ameliorate this situation through standardized assessment of anthropogenic threats to mangroves in East and Southeast Asia. The geographic focus of the project includes Brunei, China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Threats from pollution, over-harvesting, aquaculture development, boating/shipping, flooding/freshwater input, siltation and other coastal development are examined with this map-based analysis. The study particularly emphasizes information regarding the human element of these ecosystems, with an eye towards community-based management and action. A geographic information system (GIS)-based tool will be developed to examine different coastal development and management scenarios and their implications for mangrove health, diversity and value. The results will serve as an indication of the threats to these ecosystems, not as an actual measure of degradation. This information generation can be seen as a first step toward assessing global needs for the world's mangrove ecosystems that to date remain largely unassessed. The analysis is intended to recommend policies, participatory approaches and management strategies to promote integrated coastal ecosystem approaches. It will help fill an information void through much-needed policy guidance on management and priority setting.},

  abstract = {To estimate the impact of light-colored surfaces (roofs and pavements) and urban vegetation (trees, grass, shrubs) on meteorology and air quality of a city, it is essential to accurately characterize various urban surfaces. Of particular importance is the characterization of the area fraction of various surface-types as well as the vegetative fraction. In this paper, a method is discussed for developing data on surface-type distribution and city-fabric (land cover) makeup (percentage of various surface-types) using high-resolution orthophtos. We devised a semi-automatic Monte Carlo method to sample the data and visually identify the surface-type for each pixel. The color aerial photographs for Sacramento covered a total of about 65 km2, at 0.3-m resolution. Five major land-use types were examined: (1) downtown and city center, (2) industrial, (3) offices, (4) commercial, and (5) residential. In downtown Sacramento, the top view (above-the-canopy) shows that vegetation covers 30\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 23\% and paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, and sidewalks) 41\%. In the industrial areas, vegetation covers 8-14\% of the area, whereas roofs cover 19-23\%, and paved surfaces 29-44\%. The surface-type percentages in the office area were 21\% trees, 16\% roofs, and 49\% paved areas. In commercial areas, vegetation covers 5-20\%, roofs 19-20\%, paved surfaces 44-68\%. Residential areas exhibit a wide range of percentages among their various surface-types. On average, vegetation covers about 36\% of the area, roofs about 20\%, and paved surfaces about 28\%. Trees mostly shade streets, parking lots, grass, and sidewalks. In most non-residential areas, paved surfaces cover 50-70\% of the under-the-canopy area. In residential areas, on average, paved surfaces cover about 35\% of the area. Land-use/land cover (LULC) data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was used to extrapolate these results from neighborhood scales to metropolitan Sacramento. Of an area of roughly 800 km2, defining most urban areas of the metropolitan Sacramento, about half is residential. The total roof area comprises about 150 km2 and the total paved surfaces (roads, parking areas, sidewalks) are about 310 km2. The total vegetated area covers about 230 km2. The remaining 110 km2 consist of barren land and miscellaneous surfaces. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Dust storm days were identified when the national daily average of PM10 exceeded 200 𝜇g/m3. Generalized additive models with Poisson link were used to estimate the relative risk (RR) of age-stratified daily mortality associated with dust events, after adjusting for potential confounders including weather variables and long-term trends. There was no significant association between dust storm events and same-day respiratory mortality (RR = 0.96; 95 \%CI 0.88–1.04), cardiovascular mortality (RR = 0.98; 95 \%CI 0.96–1.012) or all-cause mortality (RR = 0.99; 95 \%CI 0.97–1.00).

  abstract = {Introduction Outbreaks of Saharan dust have been shown to exacerbate the effect of particulate matter (PM) on mortality. Their role on PM–morbidity association is less clear. This study aims to evaluate the effect of Saharan dust on the PM–hospitalisations association in Rome, Italy. Methods We studied residents hospitalised in Rome between 2001 and 2004 and performed a time-series analysis to explore the effects of PM2.5, PM2.5–10 and PM10 on cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory emergency hospitalisations, respectively. Saharan dust days were identified by combining Light Detection and Ranging observations and analyses from operational models. We tested a dust–PM interaction to evaluate the hypothesis that the PM effect on hospitalisations would be enhanced on dust days. Results We studied 77 354, 26 557 and 31 620 hospitalisations for cardiac, cerebrovascular and respiratory diseases, respectively, providing effect estimates per IQR. PM2.5–10 was associated with cardiac diseases (3.93\%; 95\% CI 1.58 to 6.34). PM10 was associated with cardiac (3.37\%; 95\% CI 1.11 to 5.68), cerebrovascular (2.64\%; 95\% CI 0.06 to 5.29) and respiratory diseases (3.59\%: 95\% CI 0.18 to 7.12). No effect of PM2.5 was detected.

  abstract = {Abstract This study analyzed landscape changes in the Mediterranean using remotely sensed satellite images. Bitemporal Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of Erdemli (Southern Turkey) acquired by Landsat satellites were analyzed to detect landscape changes in the study area, which supports a mosaic of landscapes from coastline to altitudes over tree line. Visible and near infrared bands (i.e. bands 3 and 4) of the near-anniversary (August) images from 1984 and 2006 were used to derive Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) images. NDVI images for the earlier and later dates were analyzed. ASTER and Quickbird images, topographic maps, forest stand maps were used as ancillary data. Spatial distribution of change is mapped and interpreted. Results showed that forest regeneration took place especially in upper lands, while deforestation occurred at lower altitudes in relatively smaller patches in close proximity to the coast and to the roads.}

  abstract = {Rapid changes of land use and land cover (LULC) in urban areas have become a major environmental concern due to environmental impacts, such as the reduction of green spaces and development of urban heat islands (UHI). Monitoring and management plans are required to solve this problem effectively. The Tabriz metropolitan area in Iran, selected as a case study for this research, is an example of a fast growing city. Multi-temporal images acquired by Landsat 4, 5 TM and Landsat 7 ETM+ sensors on 30 June 1989, 18 August 1998, and 2 August 2001 respectively, were corrected for radiometric and geometric errors, and processed to extract LULC classes and land surface temperature (LST). The relationship between temporal dynamics of LST and LULC was then examined. The temperature vegetation index (TVX) space was constructed in order to study the temporal variability of thermal data and vegetation cover. Temporal trajectory of pixels in the TVX space showed that most changes due to urbanization were observable as the pixels migrated from the low temperature-dense vegetation condition to the high temperature-sparse vegetation condition in the TVX space. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the trajectory analysis in the TVX space involved a class-dependant noise component. This emphasized the need for multiple LULC control points in the TVX space. In addition, this research suggests that the use of multi-temporal satellite data together with the examination of changes in the TVX space is effective and useful in urban LULC change monitoring and analysis of urban surface temperature conditions as long as the uncertainty is addressed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Quantitative health impact assessment has become increasingly important in the development of air quality policy. For such analysis it is important to have accurate information on the concentration-response relationships for the effects investigated, for example on the relationship between changes in daily air pollution and its impact on health. Therefore, a quantitative meta-analysis of peer reviewed studies was conducted to obtain summary estimates for certain health effects linked to the exposure to particulate matter (PM) and ozone. This work was done as part of the WHO project “Systematic review of health aspects of air pollution in Europe”, which is funded by the European Commission and is intended to provide input to the Clean Air For Europe (CAFE) programme. The data for these analyses came from a database of time-series studies (ecological and individual) developed at St. George's Hospital Medical School at the University of London. The meta-analysis was also performed at St. George's Hospital according to a protocol that was agreed upon by a WHO Task Group in advance of the work. This analysis confirmed statistically significant relationships between levels of PM and ozone in ambient air with mortality, using data from several European cities. Updated risk coefficients in relation to ambient exposure to PM and ozone were obtained for all-cause (relative risk for a 10 µg/m3 increase in PM10: 1.006 (1.004, 1.008) and ozone: 1.003 (1.001, 1.004), respectively) and cause-specific mortality and hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular causes. In addition, possible publication bias was investigated and revised summary estimates were calculated. Also panel studies were analyzed to derive summary estimates for coughs and medication use in individuals with underlying respiratory disease.},

  abstract = {The direct retrieval of canopy height and the estimation of aboveground biomass are two important measures of forest structure that can be quantified by airborne laser scanning at landscape scales. These and other metrics are central to studies attempting to quantify global carbon cycles and to improve understanding of the spatial variation in forest structure evident within differing biomes. Data acquired using NASA's Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) over the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF) in central New Hampshire (USA) was used to assess the performance of waveform lidar in a northern temperate mixed conifer and deciduous forest. Using coincident plots established for this study, we found strong agreement between field and lidar measurements of height (r2 = 0.80, p ¡ 0.000) at the footprint level. Allometric calculations of aboveground biomass (AGBM) and LVIS metrics (AGBM: r2 = 0.61, PRESS RMSE = 58.0 Mg ha− 1, p ¡ 0.000) and quadratic mean stem diameter (QMSD) and LVIS metrics (r2 = 0.54, p = 0.002) also showed good agreement at the footprint level. Application of a generalized equation for determining AGBM proposed by Lefsky et al. (2002a) to footprint-level field data from Bartlett resulted in a coefficient of determination of 0.55; RMSE = 64.4 Mg ha− 1; p = 0.002. This is slightly weaker than the strongest relationship found with the best-fit single term regression model. Relationships between a permanent grid of USDA Forest Service inventory plots and the mean values of aggregated LVIS metrics, however, were not as strong. This discrepancy suggests that validation efforts must be cautious in using pre-existing field data networks as a sole means of calibrating and verifying such remote sensing data. Stratification based on land-use or species composition, however, did provide the means to improve regression relationships at this scale. Regression models established at the footprint level for AGBM and QMSD were applied to LVIS data to generate predicted values for the whole of Bartlett. The accuracy of these models was assessed using varying subsets of the USFS NERS plot data. Coefficient of determinations ranged from fair to strong with aspects of land-use history and species composition influencing both the fit and the level of error seen in the predicted relationships.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many studies have linked weather to mortality; however, role of such critical factors as regional variation, susceptible populations, and acclimatization remain unresolved. METHODS: We applied time-series models to 107 US communities allowing a nonlinear relationship between temperature and mortality by using a 14-year dataset. Second-stage analysis was used to relate cold, heat, and heat wave effect estimates to community-specific variables. We considered exposure timeframe, susceptibility, age, cause of death, and confounding from pollutants. Heat waves were modeled with varying intensity and duration. RESULTS: Heat-related mortality was most associated with a shorter lag (average of same day and previous day), with an overall increase of 3.0\% (95\% posterior interval: 2.4\%-3.6\%) in mortality risk comparing the 99th and 90th percentile temperatures for the community. Cold-related mortality was most associated with a longer lag (average of current day up to 25 days previous), with a 4.2\% (3.2\%-5.3\%) increase in risk comparing the first and 10th percentile temperatures for the community. Mortality risk increased with the intensity or duration of heat waves. Spatial heterogeneity in effects indicates that weather-mortality relationships from 1 community may not be applicable in another. Larger spatial heterogeneity for absolute temperature estimates (comparing risk at specific temperatures) than for relative temperature estimates (comparing risk at community-specific temperature percentiles) provides evidence for acclimatization. We identified susceptibility based on age, socioeconomic conditions, urbanicity, and central air conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: Acclimatization, individual susceptibility, and community characteristics all affect heat-related effects on mortality.},

Recent developments in spaceborne and airborne instruments with multiple view angle (MVA) capabilities have resulted in a demand for ground measurements to support these missions. Lightweight portable spectroradiometers offer an appropriate means of collecting MVA spectral reflectance factor data because they are more easily manoeuvrable than other spectroradiometers, but their physical capabilities have not yet been explored in this context. This letter presents the results of a focused experiment aimed at evaluating the field capabilities of a miniaturized Ocean Optics instrument in MVA settings for soil surface roughness applications. MVA hemispherical-conical reflectance factors were collected in situ from soil surfaces whose roughness was determined using a laser profiling survey. The results showed a significant negative relationship (R 2 = 0.74; p ¡ 0.01) between directional reflectance factors measured at 870 nm in the forward-scattering region and a soil structural measure derived from laser profiling data. This corroborates the results of other published studies and suggests that Ocean Optics instruments can be used to support hyperspectral MVA investigations.}

More generally, cities are now expanding at twice their population growth rates, on average, and now cover almost 0.5\% of the planet's land area. We created a new dataset comprising the universe of all 3646 named metropolitan agglomerations and cities that had populations in excess of 100,000 in the year 2000, their populations in that year, and their built-up area identified in the Mod500 map, currently the best of eight satellite-based global maps of urban land cover. Using this dataset, we estimated urban land cover in smaller cities and towns in all countries and calculated total urban land cover in every country in the year 2000. We then employed multiple regression models that could explain more than 90\% of the variations in our urban land cover estimates amongst countries. Then, using U.N. urban population projections in combination with three realistic density change scenarios based on our previous global and historical study of densities, we projected urban land cover in every country and world region from 2000 to 2050. According to our medium projection, urban land cover in developing countries will increase from 300,000km2 in 2000 to 770,000km2 in 2030 and to 1,200,000km2 in 2050. Containing this expansion is likely to fail. Minimal preparations for accommodating it - realistic projection of urban land needs, the extension of metropolitan boundaries, acquiring the rights-of-way for an arterial road grid that can carry infrastructure and public transport, and the selective protection of open space from incursion by formal and informal land development - are now in order. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

This fact, coupled with the increasing world population living in urban areas, requires the development of a detailed and reliable map of global urban extent. This letter reports on a new approach for urban mapping from Landsat images, based on the Normalized Difference Spectral Vector (NDSV). This spectral transformation allows the creation of a normalized signature that becomes peculiar of each land cover class within the scene. The urban extent classification is obtained by analyzing the NDSV data in conjunction with a Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) based classifier. The experiments presented in this letter show the effectiveness of the proposed technique in detecting urban areas in extremely different environments. The results of the proposed methodology have been compared with the ones obtained by classifying the NDSV using other classifiers [namely, maximum likehood (ML) and support vector machines (SVM)], and also to the results obtained by classifying the calibrated data using the ML, SVM and SAM classifiers. The NDSV+SAM approach has provided the best results, with an overall accuracy of 97\%.},

In this study, forest inventory data and multiple ground scans were obtained in a sparse managed and dense natural riparian forest on the immediate banks of the mid-lower portion of the Garonne River in Southern France, dominated by black poplar (Populus nigra) and commercial hybrid poplars (Populus × euramericana). Overall, the ground-based laser-scanning analysis successfully estimated trunk diameters, tree heights and crown radii from both managed and natural riparian forests. However, the ground scanner analysis was not as successful in identifying all of the trunks in the dense natural riparian forest, with only 141 trunks identified from a total of 234. This also results in allometric scaling exponents for ground scanning, which are significantly different from field-derived exponents. This study thus shows that there may be a limit to the number of trees detected in higher density forests, even with multiple scans.}

  abstract = {AbstractNear Perth, Western Australia, thirty boreholes were drilled at eleven sites in similar hydrogeological settings. The sites represent three levels of urban development: an uncleared area, a new residential area (less than 20 years old) and an old residential area (more than 60 years old). The objective was to assess the impact of sewered urban development on recharge and groundwater quality. Tritium data suggest that a greater proportion of recharge in the urban areas is from point sources, and this probably caused high redox potentials (up to 291 mV) in groundwater in the old residential area. Recharge in the new urban area is estimated to be about 37 percent of the average annual rainfall of about 0.8 m, and this value is probably greater than recharge in undeveloped areas. Concentrations of sulphate increase progressively with the age of urban development, from an average of 8 mg/L to 69 mg/L, probably as a result of fertilizer input and the oxidation of soil-held sulphides with land clearing. Nitrate concentrations are significantly higher in urban areas (average concentration ¿1 mg/L as N) than in the non-urban areas (average concentration ¡0.5 mg/L as N). However, the measured concentrations are all lower than expected from current fertilizer inputs in sewered urban areas of about 80 kg/ha, indicating that denitrification is taking place. A limited reservoir of reducing agents may be available from denitrification, and this may have implications for the sustained use of groundwater as a potable supply in coastal suburbs of Perth. R\&Eacute;SUM\&Eacute;: Pr\&egrave;s de Perth, en Australie occidentale, 30 forages ont \&eacute;t\&eacute; r\&eacute;alis\&eacute;s en 11 sites dans les m\&ecirc;mes conditions hydrog\&eacute;ologiques. Ces sites pr\&eacute;sentent trois degr\&eacute;s de d\&eacute;veloppement urbain: une zone non am\&eacute;nag\&eacute;e, une zone r\&eacute;sidentielle nouvelle (de moins de 20 ans), une zone r\&eacute;sidentielle ancienne (de plus de 60 ans). L'objectif \&eacute;tait de d\&eacute;terminer l'impact de l'assainissement urbain sur la recharge et sur la qualit\&eacute; des eaux souterraines. Les donn\&eacute;es de tritium indiquent qu'une recharge plus importante se produit ponctuellement dans les zones construites, ce qui est probablement responsable des potentiels redox \&eacute;lev\&eacute;s (jusqu'\&agrave; 291 mV) dans l'eau souterraine \&agrave; long temps de s\&eacute;jour. La recharge dans la zone nouvellement urbanis\&eacute;e est d'environ 37\% des pr\&eacute;cipitations moyennes annuelles (800 mm); cette valeur parait sup\&eacute;rieure \&agrave; celle de la recharge dans les zones non urbanis\&eacute;es. Les concentrations en sulfates augmentent progressivement avec l'\&acirc;ge du d\&eacute;veloppement urbain, de 8 \&agrave; 69 mg/l en moyenne, probablement \&agrave; cause des apports d'engrais et de l'oxydation des sulfures lors du lessivage des sols. Les teneurs en nitrates sont significativement plus fortes en zones urbanis\&eacute;es (concentration moyenne sup\&eacute;rieure \&agrave; 1 mg/l en N) qu'en zones non urbanis\&eacute;es (concentration moyenne inf\&eacute;rieure \&agrave; 0.5 mg/l en N). Ces teneurs restent cependant nettement inf\&eacute;rieurs \&agrave; celles que produiraient, comme on le connait, des apports continus d'engrais de 80 kg/ha en zone urbanis\&eacute;e avec assainissement, ce qui prouve qu'une d\&eacute;nitrification se produit. Un r\&eacute;servoir limit\&eacute; d'agents r\&eacute;ducteurs doit donc intervenir dans la d'\&eacute;nitrification, ce qui peut avoir des implications pour une utilisation durable des eaux souterraines pour l'alimentation en eau potable dans la banlieue c\&ocirc;ti\&egrave;re de Perth. RESUMEN: Cerca de Perth, Australia Occidental, se perforaron treinta sondeos en once localizaciones con similares caracter\&iacute;sticas hidrogeol\&oacute;gicas. Las localizaciones representan tres niveles de desarrollo urbano: un area no desarrollada, un area residencial moderna (menos de veinte a\&ntilde;os de edad) y un \&aacute;rea residencial antigua (m\&aacute;s de 60 a\&ntilde;os). El objetivo era evaluar el impacto del desarrollo en las redes de saneamiento urbanas en la recarga y calidad de las aguas subterr\&aacute;neas. Los datos de tritio sugieren que una gran proporci\&oacute;n de la recarga en \&aacute;reas urbanas procede de focos puntuales; esto es una posible causa de los altos potenciales redox (hasta 291 mV) de las aguas subterr\&aacute;neas en el \&aacute;rea residencial antigua. La recarga en el \&aacute;rea urbana moderna se estima sobre el 37\% de la precipitaci\&oacute;n anual media, de alrededor de 0.8 m, y este valor es probablemente mayor que la recarga en \&aacute;reas no desarrolladas. Las concentraciones de sulfato aumentan progresivamente con la edad del desarrollo urbano, desde una media de 8 mg/l hasta 69 mg/l, probablemente como resultado del aporte de fertilizantes y de la oxidaci\&oacute;n de los sulfuros retenidos durante la explanaci\&oacute;n del terreno. Las concentraciones de nitratos son significativamente m\&aacute;s altas en \&aacute;reas urbanas (concentraci\&oacute;n media ¿ 1mg/l en forma de N) que en \&aacute;reas no urbanas (concentraci\&oacute;n media ¡ 0.5 mg/l en forma de N). Sin embargo, las concentraciones medidas son todas menores que las esperadas a partir de los valores de aporte de fertilizantes habituales en \&aacute;reas urbanas con red de saneamiento, que son del orden de 80 kg/ha. Esto indica que est\&aacute; teniendo lugar un proceso de desnitrificaci\&oacute;n. Esta desnitrificaci\&oacute;n puede ser posible por la presencia de una acumulaci\&oacute;n limitada de agentes reductores, lo que puede tener implicaciones para el uso sostenido del agua subterr\&aacute;nea como suministro de agua potable en los suburbios costeros de Perth.},

  abstract = {Groundwater in the Gwelup groundwater management area in Perth, Western Australia has been enriched in As due to the exposure of pyritic sediments caused by reduced rainfall, increased groundwater abstraction for irrigation and water supply, and prolonged dewatering carried out during urban construction activities. Groundwater near the watertable in a 25-60 m thick unconfined sandy aquifer has become acidic and has affected shallow wells used for garden irrigation. Arsenic concentrations up to 7000 𝜇g/L were measured in shallow groundwater, triggering concerns about possible health effects if residents were to use water from household wells as a drinking water source. Deep production wells used for public water supply are not affected by acidity, but trends of progressively increasing concentrations of Fe, SO4 and Ca over a 30-a period indicate that pyrite oxidation products extend to the base of the unconfined aquifer. Falling Eh values are triggering the release of As from the reduction of Fe(III) oxyhydroxide minerals near the base of the unconfined aquifer, increasing the risk that groundwater used as a drinking water source will also become contaminated with high concentrations of As.},

In the first part of the experimental approach a passive technique is developed to calculate emissivity from two-band thermal infrared radiance data. Inherent limitations and sources of error associated with the technique are discussed. In the second part of the experimental approach the technique was used to measure the emissivity of 1411 roofs within the city limits of Terre Haute, Indiana. Results of this survey indicated that over 98\% of the roofs surveyed were confined to a very narrow range of emissivities.

This new index was applied to distinguish built-up and bare land areas in Denpasar (Bali, Indonesia) and had a high accuracy level when compared to existing indices. The EBBI was more effective at discriminating built-up and bare land areas and at increasing the accuracy of the built-up density percentage than five other indices. © 2012 by the authors.},

The result is that most NOAA AVHRR pixels contain a mixture of land cover types (sub-pixel mixing). Three techniques for mapping the sub-pixel proportions of land cover classes in the New Forest, U.K. were compared: (i) artificial neural networks (ANN); (ii) mixture modelling; and (iii) fuzzy c -means classification. NOAA AVHRR imagery and SPOT HRV imagery, both for 28 June 1994, were obtained. The SPOT HRV images were classified using the maximum likelihood method, and used to derive the 'known' sub-pixel proportions of each land cover class for each NOAA AVHRR pixel. These data were then used to evaluate the predictions made (using the three techniques and the NOAA AVHRR imagery) in terms of the amount of information provided, the accuracy with which that information is provided, and the ease of implementation. The ANN was the most accurate technique, but its successful implementation depended on accurate co-registration and the availability of a training data set. Supervised fuzzy c -means classification was slightly more accurate than mixture modelling.},

  abstract = {Traditional spectral classification of remotely sensed images applied on a pixel-by-pixel basis ignores the potentially useful spatial information between the values of proximate pixels. For some 30 years the spatial information inherent in remotely sensed images has been employed, albeit by a limited number of researchers, to enhance spectral classification. This has been achieved primarily by filtering the original imagery to (i) derive texture 'wavebands' for subsequent use in classification or (ii) smooth the imagery prior to (or after) classification. Recently, the variogram has been used to represent formally the spatial dependence in remotely sensed images and used in texture classification in place of simple variance filters. However, the variogram has also been employed in soil survey as a smoothing function for unsupervised classification. In this review paper, various methods of incorporating spatial information into the classification of remotely sensed images are considered. The focus of the paper is on the variogram in classification both as a measure of texture and as a guide to choice of smoothing function. In the latter case, the paper focuses on the technique developed for soil survey and considers the modification that would be necessary for the remote sensing case. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Increasing population and life standards causes fossil fuel consumption to increase. Due to this increasing consumption, fossil fuels are being depleted rapidly. In addition to rapid exhaustion, another important problem associated with fossil fuels is that their consumption has major negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, many countries around the world have included renewable energy systems (RES) in their future energy plans so that they can produce reliable and environmentally friendly energy. Parallel to this trend, various RES have been identified and recently integrated into the current energy network of Turkey as well. However, it should be recognized that renewable energy resources are not fully environmentally safe. Different RES are associated with different environmental impacts. In planning the future energy development of a country, evaluation of renewable energy resources potentials together with their associated environmental impacts is critical. The aim of this study is to create a decision support system for site selection of wind turbines using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools. Wind energy potential and environmental fitness/acceptability are used as decision criteria for the site selection process. Potential environmental impacts of wind generation are identified in accordance with Turkish legislations and previous studies; and represented as fuzzy objectives of the decision problem. Wind potential map of Turkey generated by General Directorate of Electrical Power Resources Survey and Development is used to identify economically feasible locations in terms of wind energy generation. A study area composed of Usak, Aydin, Denizli, Mugla, and Burdur provinces in Turkey is selected and divided into 250 m × 250 m grids. Each grid represents an alternative location for a wind turbine or group of wind turbines. Fuzzy environmental objectives such as “Acceptable in terms of noise level”, “Acceptable in terms of bird habitat”, “Acceptable in terms of safety and aesthetics” and “Safe in terms of natural reserves” associated with wind turbines are identified based on previous research and each of these objectives are represented by a fuzzy set. Individual satisfaction degree of each of these environmental objectives for each grid is calculated. Then these individual satisfactions are aggregated into an overall satisfaction degree using various aggregator operators such as “and”, “or”, and “order weighted averaging.” Thus, an overall satisfaction degree of all the environmental objectives is obtained for each grid in the study area. A map of environmental fitness is developed in GIS environment by using these overall satisfaction degrees. Then this map is utilized together with the wind potential map of Turkey to identify both potentially and environmentally feasible wind turbine locations within the study area.},

The approach presented in this paper aims for an universal high-quality solution applicable and adaptable to many problems and data types. As each image analysis problem deals with structures of a certain spatial scale, the average image objects size must be free adaptable to the scale of interest. This is achieved by a general segmentation algorithm based on homogeneity definitions in combination with local and global optimizat ion techniques. A scale parameter is used to control the average image object size. Different homogeneity criteria for image objects based on spectral and/or spatial information are developed and compared.},

  abstract = {An increase in public awareness regarding the negative impact of traditional power-generating methods, especially coal and oil-fired power stations, on the environment has created a demand for developing and using environmentally friendly renewable energy. Wind power is a popular and safe form of renewable energy. It can be economically viable, does not produce any physical pollution and can contribute radically to the reduction in air pollution. In the UK, the demand for wind energy is mounting. However, achieving the goal set by the EU will require a substantial expansion. Planning and environmental restrictions and conflicts would inevitably accompany this growth. A questionnaire targeting relevant public and private sectors in the UK has revealed the lack of coherent national criteria for locating wind farms. Using information from the questionnaire and the available published literature, simple Geographical Information System (GIS)-assisted wind farm location criteria were developed for the UK. A GIS (IDRISI) was employed to apply these criteria using two different methods to combine information layers for a site in Lancashire. The first considered all the layers as being equally important and gave them equal weight. The second grouped the layers and graded them according to perceived importance. The outputs were composed of classes from 0 to 10, where 0 represents ideal locations and 10 represents unsuitable locations. Using the second method has resulted in a slight increase in the geographical extent for the most suitable sites. These maps can be used to assist in the decision-making process when locating wind farm sites.},

Therefore, understanding the distribution and dynamics of the land-cover changes in cities is essential for better understanding of the cities' fundamental characteristics and processes, and of the impact of changing land-cover on potential carbon storage. We present a grid square approach using multi-temporal Landsat data from around 1985–2010 to monitor the spatiotemporal land-cover dynamics of 50 global cities. The maximum-likelihood classification method is applied to Landsat data to define the cities' urbanized areas at different points in time. Subsequently, 1 km2 grid squares with unique cell IDs are designed to link among land-cover maps for spatio-temporal land-cover change analysis. Then, we calculate land-cover category proportions for each map in 1 km2 grid cells. Statistical comparison of the land-cover changes in grid square cells shows that urban area expansion in 50 global cities was strongly negatively correlated with forest, cropland and grassland changes. The generated land-cover proportions in 1 km2 grid cells and the spatial relationships between the changes of land-cover classes are critical for understanding past patterns and the consequences of urban development so as to inform future urban planning, risk management and conservation strategies.},

Part of the vast and widely dispersed information on air quality that is available at this time on the Internet was compiled, thus making possible a comprehensive evaluation of the tendencies that emerged at the end of the 20th century. Likewise, these values are compared to the air quality thresholds recommended by two international organizations: guideline levels of the World Health Organization (WHO) and limit values of the European Union (EU), in order to determine air quality concentration levels in large cities around the world. The current situation of air quality worldwide indicates that SO(2) maintains a downward tendency throughout the world, with the exception of some Central American and Asian cities. NO(2) maintains levels very close to the WHO guideline value around the world. For particulate matter, it is a major problem in almost all of Asia, exceeding 300 microg/m(3) in many cities. Ozone shows average values that exceed the selected guideline values in all of the analyses demonstrating that it is a global problem. In general, the worldwide trend is to a reduction in the concentrations of pollutants because of the increasingly strong restrictions which local governments and international organizations impose. However, in poor countries and those with low average incomes, concentrations of air pollutants remain high and the trend will be the elevation of their ground levels as they develop, making the problem even worse.}

Results from a generalised linear model show that spatial variables explain away a good deal of the country-specific variation in mortality, and that they are associated with (and may be mediated by) the household characteristics.

Cities are vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change because of their concentration of people and infrastructure, the physical (geographical, material, and structural) attributes of the built environment, and the ecological interdependence with the urban ecosystem. Australia is one of the most highly urbanized countries in the region and its already variable climate is set to become hotter and drier with climate change. Climate change in Australia is expected to increase morbidity and mortality from thermal stress, bacterial gastroenteritis, vector-borne disease, air pollution, flooding, and bushfires. The cost and availability of fresh water, food, and energy will also likely be affected. The more vulnerable urban populations, including the elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and those with underlying chronic disease, will be most affected. Adaptation strategies need to address this underlying burden of disease and inequity as well as implement broad structural changes to building codes and urban design, and infrastructure capacity. In doing so, cities provide opportunities to realize "co-benefits" for health (eg, from increased levels of physical activity and improved air quality). With evidence that climate change is underway, the need for cities to be a focus in the development of climate adaptation strategies is becoming more urgent.},

  abstract = {Four aerosol optical depth retrieval algorithms over the Sahara Desert during June 2011 from the IASI, MISR, MODIS, and SEVIRI satellite instruments are compared against each other in order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each retrieval approach. Particular attention is paid to the effects of meteorological conditions, land surface properties, and the magnitude of the dust loading. The period of study corresponds to the time of the first Fennec intensive measurement campaign, which provides new ground-based and aircraft measurements of the dust characteristics and loading. Validation using ground-based AERONET sunphotometer data indicates that of the satellite products, the SEVIRI retrieval is most able to retrieve dust during optically thick dust events, whereas IASI and MODIS perform better at low dust loadings. This may significantly affect observations of dust emission and the mean dust climatology. MISR and MODIS are least sensitive to variations in meteorological conditions, while SEVIRI tends to overestimate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) under moist conditions (with a bias against AERONET of 0.31), especially at low dust loadings where the AOD ¡ 1. Further comparisons are made with airborne LIDAR measurements taken during the Fennec campaign, which provide further evidence for the inferences made from the AERONET comparisons. The effect of surface properties on the retrievals is also investigated. Over elevated surfaces IASI retrieves AODs which are most consistent with AERONET observations, while the AODs retrieved by MODIS tend to be biased low. In contrast, over the least emissive surfaces IASI significantly underestimates the AOD (with a bias of − 0.41), while MISR and SEVIRI show closest agreement.},

  abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) mapping is attracting growing interest from landscape and urban planning, but its operationalization in actual decision-making is still limited. A clear distinction between ES capacity, flow and demand can improve the usefulness of ES mapping as a decision-support tool by informing planners and policy-makers where ES are used unsustainably and where ES flow is failing to meet societal demand. This paper advances a framework for mapping and assessing the relationships between ES capacity, flow and demand with a focus on the identification of unsatisfied demand. The framework was tested in the Barcelona metropolitan region, Spain, considering two ES of critical relevance for the urban population: air purification and outdoor recreation. For both ES, spatial indicators of capacity, flow, demand and unsatisfied demand were developed using proxy- and process-based models. The results show a consistent spatial pattern of all these components along the urban-rural gradient for the two ES assessed. The flow of both ES mainly takes place in the periurban green areas whereas the highest capacity values are mostly found in the protected areas located on the outskirts of the metropolitan region. As expected, ES demand and particularly unsatisfied demand are mostly situated in the main urban core (i.e., Barcelona and adjacent cities). Our assessment also reveals that the current landscape planning instrument for the metropolitan region mostly protects areas with high capacity to provide ES, but might lead to declining ES flows in periurban areas due to future urban developments. We contend that the mapping of ES capacity, flow and demand can contribute to the successful integration of the ES approach in landscape and urban planning because it provides a comprehensive picture of the ES delivery process, considering both ecological and social underlying factors. However, we identify three main issues that should be better addressed in future research: (1) improvement of ES demand indicators using participatory methods; (2) integration of ecological thresholds into the analysis; and (3) use of a multi-scale approach that covers both the local and regional planning levels and cross-scale interactions between them.}

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) technology is capable of precisely measuring a variety of vegetation metrics, the estimates of which are usually based on relative heights above a digital elevation model (DEM). As a result, the development of these elevation models is a critical step when processing lidar observations. A number of different algorithms exist to interpolate lidar ground hits into a terrain surface. We tested seven interpolation routines, using small footprint lidar data, collected over a range of vegetation classes on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. The lidar data were randomly subsetted into a prediction dataset and a validation dataset. A suite of DEMs were then generated using linear, quintic, natural neighbour, regularized spline, spline with tension, a finite difference approach (ANUDEM), and inverse distance weighted interpolation routines, at spatial resolutions of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m. In order to examine the effects of terrain and ground cover on interpolation accuracies, the study area was stratified by terrain slope, vegetation structural class, lidar ground return density, and normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) derived from Quickbird and Landsat7 ETM+ imagery. The root mean square (RMS) and mean absolute errors of the residuals between the surfaces and the validation points indicated that the 0.5 m DEMs were the most accurate. Of the tested approaches, the regularized spline and IDW algorithms produced the most extreme outliers, sometimes in excess of ±6 m in sloping terrain. Overall, the natural neighbour algorithm provided the best results with a minimum of effort. Finally, a method to create prediction uncertainty maps using classification and regression tree (CART) analysis is proposed.},

The objective is to minimize the sum of the weighted time components between the moment a donor organ becomes available and its transplantation into the recipient's body. The weight factor for the elapsed time before the organ's removal from the donor body allows to assign a lower weight to this time component in the objective function in order to reflect the criticality of the process after the organ's removal. The specificity of organ transplants makes the model more complex than a traditional facility location model. The model is applied to the Belgian organ transplant path. Extensive numerical experiments reveal the key factors that impact the long-term decision of centralizing versus decentralizing transplant centers.},

  abstract = {This study has been performed in order to evaluate the land use changes and related environmental impacts which occurred in recent decades in the Lamone river basin (Northern Italian Apennines). Using the DPSIR indicator-based approach, agricultural land use changes and conversions occurred within the periods 1976–1994 and 1994–2003, have been associated with the shortage of water in the river and the modification of the landscape structure. Results show that Lamone river basin in 1976 was mainly dominated by forest (27.4\%) and cropland (32.3\%) and through the entire period the valley presented a strong persistence of land uses and the main conversions detected are afforestation and agricultural intensification. The hydrological balance analysis results indicate that the agricultural intensification process produced a water deficit in summer periods equal to 0.89 mln m3 in 2003. The landscape of the Lamone valley became more homogeneous, showing a decrease in diversity (Shannon Diversity Index values decreased from 1.81 to 1.58) and the riparian corridor became more human-dominated (Human Habitat values increased from 0.61 to 0.77). An integrated assessment of possible management options has been conducted, using the MULINO-DSS software as a support. Thirteen different management scenarios have been produced in order to solve the water balance issue and to enhance the riparian corridor. Attributing equal weight to the environmental, social and economical criteria, the best solution corresponds to the sole creation of artificial basins and the actual situation is placed at position 8 (out of 13).},

This paper provides an overview of various existing methodologies for assessing progress towards the SDGs. It provides guidance on how to choose an appropriate method that is fit for the purpose of analysis. The paper also recommends an approach for measuring SDG progress that accounts for progress among the furthest left behind groups in order to fulfil the leave no-one behind ambition of the 2030 agenda. Applying the new approach to data from countries in Asia-Pacific region shows that, when disaggregated statistics are available, the inclusive measurement can significantly change the progress narrative and our understanding of priorities for SDGs implementation.},

The first derives from constructivist learning theory, and the second from the instructional design literature. Constructivism comprises a family of theories but all have in common the centrality of the learner's activities in creating meaning. These and related ideas have important implications for teaching and assessment. Instructional designers for their part have emphasised alignment between the objectives of a course or unit and the targets for assessing student performance. “Constructive alignment” represents a marriage of the two thrusts, constructivism being used as a framework to guide decision-making at all stages in instructional design: in deriving curriculum objectives in terms of performances that represent a suitably high cognitive level, in deciding teaching/learning activities judged to elicit those performances, and to assess and summatively report student performance. The “performances of understanding” nominated in the objectives are thus used to systematically align the teaching methods and the assessment. The process is illustrated with reference to a professional development unit in educational psychology for teachers, but the model may be generalized to most units or programs in higher education.},

Time series of precipitation and flows over a 30-year period were analysed for trends in extremes. The Mann–Kendall (MK) non-parametric test was used to detect trends at six rain gauges and five flow gauges across the catchment. Maxima, percentiles and N-day maxima of precipitation and flow distributions were investigated to identify changes in extreme intensity, frequency and persistence, respectively. Results indicated some significant statistical trends at annual, seasonal, and monthly scales. The largest number of significant trends in extreme precipitation was identified at mountainous gauge locations where significant increases in extreme precipitation persistence were detected annually and during spring and winter. Additionally, significant increases in extreme precipitation frequency were observed annually and during autumn and winter. Trends in flow identified an increase in extreme intensity on an annual basis, as well as during winter and the month of July, and a decrease in extreme frequency at certain stations during spring. Changes in climate variables were investigated to identify causal relationships with precipitation and flow hydrological extremes. Extremes were found to coincide with certain weather types, generally characteristic of cyclonic conditions and/or orographic enhancement. These were largely correlated with strong positive and negative stages of the North Atlantic oscillation, particularly during winter. Snow cover records indicated rapid decline in the Severn Uplands and a reduction in snow indicated a link to changes in spring hydrological extremes. All changes seemed to be driven by the underlying climate variable of air temperature, which coincided with changes in observed national and global temperature records. Hydroclimatological changes indicated a possible temporal shift in the occurrence of extreme hydrological events, which was likely to have been affected by changes in catchment physical properties.},

  abstract = {Constructive alignment (CA) is an outcomes-based approach to teaching in which the learning outcomes that students are intended to achieve are defined before teaching takes place. Teaching and assessment methods are then designed to best achieve those outcomes and to assess the standard at which they have been achieved. Although the general idea of CA has been around for some time, it is only recently that it has been implemented on a reasonably large scale. Part of the reason for this is that the massive expansion in tertiary education involves a diverse range of students and of teaching subjects so that teaching and assessment need to be reviewed on an institution-wide basis with emphasis upon outcomes at institutional, programme and unit levels. CA provides a framework for adjusting teaching and assessment to address the attainment of those outcomes and the standards reached. Research indicates that CA is effective in this but it initially requires time and effort in designing teaching and assessment and, as a systems approach, it is important that supporting institutional policies and procedures are in place. CA properly implemented enhances teaching and learning quality and thus, as a form of quality enhancement, subsumes forms of quality assurance that can often be counter-productive.},

The ultimate aim of such work is obtaining datasets useful to support, in a GIS environment, the decision makers in developing adequate strategies to reduce energy consumption and CO2 emission. In the processing proposed, the computing of radiometric quantities related to the atmosphere was performed by the Modtran 5 radiative transfer code, while an object-oriented supervised classification was applied on a WorldView-2 multispectral image, together with a high-resolution digital surface model (DSM), to distinguish among the major roofing material types and to model the effects of the emissivity. The emissivity values were derived from literature data, except for some roofing materials, which were measured during ad hoc surveys, by means of a thermal camera and a contact probe. These preliminary results demonstrate the high sensitivity of the model to the variability of the surface emissivity and of the atmospheric parameters, especially transmittance and upwelling radiance.},

The methodology has been applied and tested over a geographic region in the Southern Italy characterized by different surface features: arid, cultivated, vegetated and urban areas, and sea water. The objective is to implement a real-time continuous monitoring of surface parameters, which could be used for the various purposes of tourism and agronomy, land surveillance, natural hazards and risk assessment analysis. Retrieval of surface parameters has been performed for the whole year 2013 and the results have been compared to other similar satellite observations such as those derived from AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and MODIS (Moderate Reso-lution Imaging Spectroradiometer).

The project aims at deriving area estimates of tropical forest cover change for the periods 1990–2000–2005. The paper presents the pre-processing steps applied in an operational and robust manner to this large amount of multi-date and multi-scene imagery: conversion to top-of-atmosphere reflectance, cloud and cloud shadow detection, haze correction and image radiometric normalization. The results show that the haze correction algorithm has improved the visual appearance of the image and significantly corrected the digital numbers for Landsat visible bands, especially the red band. The impact of the normalization procedures (forest normalization and relative normalization) was assessed on 210 image pairs: in all cases the correlation between the spectral values of the same land cover in both images was improved. The developed automatic pre-processing chain provided a consistent multi-temporal data set across the tropics that will constitute the basis for an automatic object-based supervised classification.},

  abstract = {Appraisal of ecological impacts has been problematic because of the behavior of ecological system and the responses of these systems to human intervention are far from fully understood. While it has been relatively easy to itemize the potential ecological impacts, it has been difficult to arrive at accurate predictions of how these impacts affect populations, communities, or ecosystems. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of ecological systems has been overlooked because its examination is practically impossible through matrix techniques, the most commonly used impact assessment approach. Besides, the public has become increasingly aware of the importance of the EIA in decision-making and thus the interpretation of impact significance is complicated further by the different value judgments of stakeholders. Moreover, impact assessments are carried out with a minimum of data, high uncertainty, and poor conceptual understanding. Hence, the evaluation of ecological impacts entails the integration of subjective and often conflicting judgments from a variety of experts and stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to present an environmental impact assessment approach based on the integration fuzzy logic, geographical information systems and optimization techniques. This approach enables environmental analysts to deal with the intrinsic imprecision and ambiguity associated with the judgments of experts and stakeholders, the description of ecological systems, and the prediction of ecological impacts. The application of this approach is illustrated through an example, which shows how consensus about impact mitigation can be attained within a conflict resolution framework.},

The approach employs several multi-temporal Landsat acquisitions to account for forest cover changes larger than 0.5 ha for the period from March 2002 to July 2011. In contrast to automated approaches that strongly curtail mapping time, the approach introduced here allowed us to map only the real forest cover change, based on a robust validation and rectification of the detected forest change. Derived high spatial resolution data of forest change estimates indicate that about 5.7\% (47,670.5 ha) of the observed forest area was subject to human-induced change between 2002 and 2011. Moreover, the detected forest cover changes, most of which are identifiable as timber harvesting, are considerably larger than those reported in the official statistics and often fall within the perimeter of restricted areas (i.e., national parks and natural reserves).},

  abstract = {This study presents a thorough approach, based on the application of multi-spectral remote sensing Landsat imagery, to determine human-induced forest cover change in Italy during the decade 2002–2011. A total of 785.6 ×1 04 ha of forestland was mapped using the main forest classes described within the CORINE land cover 2006 database (3.11 – broad-leaved forest; 3.12 – coniferous forest; 3.13 – mixed forest). The approach employs multi-temporal Landsat imagery to determine large-scale spatiotemporal variations in forest cover with a high degree of precision. The semi-automated procedure is based on Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) pixel-oriented image differencing technique. The results were validated and rectified as a result of on-screen visual interpretation, whereby all the false-positive forest changes that were incorrectly mapped during the automatic procedure were identified and removed. The derived high-resolution data of forest cover change show that 317,535 ha (4.04\% of the total forest area in Italy) were harvested during the period under review. The 125,272 individual clear-cut areas identified are mainly located within protected areas of the European Natura 2000 network. The outcome of this study is a publicly accessible database that can encourage further studies in the framework of international biodiversity and soil protection conventions (http://eusoils.jrc.ec.europa.eu/library/themes/erosion/italy/).

  abstract = {The term "Geographic Information Systems" (GIS) has been added to MeSH in 2003, a step reflecting the importance and growing use of GIS in health and healthcare research and practices. GIS have much more to offer than the obvious digital cartography (map) functions. From a community health perspective, GIS could potentially act as powerful evidence-based practice tools for early problem detection and solving. When properly used, GIS can: inform and educate (professionals and the public); empower decision-making at all levels; help in planning and tweaking clinically and cost-effective actions, in predicting outcomes before making any financial commitments and ascribing priorities in a climate of finite resources; change practices; and continually monitor and analyse changes, as well as sentinel events. Yet despite all these potentials for GIS, they remain under-utilised in the UK National Health Service (NHS). This paper has the following objectives: (1) to illustrate with practical, real-world scenarios and examples from the literature the different GIS methods and uses to improve community health and healthcare practices, e.g., for improving hospital bed availability, in community health and bioterrorism surveillance services, and in the latest SARS outbreak; (2) to discuss challenges and problems currently hindering the wide-scale adoption of GIS across the NHS; and (3) to identify the most important requirements and ingredients for addressing these challenges, and realising GIS potential within the NHS, guided by related initiatives worldwide. The ultimate goal is to illuminate the road towards implementing a comprehensive national, multi-agency spatio-temporal health information infrastructure functioning proactively in real time. The concepts and principles presented in this paper can be also applied in other countries, and on regional (e.g., European Union) and global levels. PMID: 14748927},

Climate change brings uncertainty in ways that cities have not tackled previously. There is a need to explore new governance forms able to deal with change and to enable transformations. In this paper we explore seven local climate innovations to better understand the enabling conditions underpinning success and the governance barriers that are encountered. We connect the more formal and emergent climate governance 'innovations' through adaptation and mitigation experiments in Mumbai, India. Case studies indicate an emerging development model. Effective climate governance has to be an inevitable part of new development in the South. While climate externality exists in all development planning and implementation, smaller community-level efforts indicate how opportunities are offered within existing systems to integrate with larger institutional climate governance.},

  abstract = {Forest cover change is one of the most important land cover change processes globally, and old-growth forests continue to disappear despite many efforts to protect them. At the same time, many countries are on a trajectory of increasing forest cover, and secondary, plantation, and scrub forests are a growing proportion of global forest cover. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for understanding how forests change in response to forest protection strategies and economic development, but most forest monitoring with satellite imagery does not distinguish old-growth forest from other forest types. Our goal was to measure changes in forest types, and especially old-growth forests, in the biodiversity hotspot of northwest Yunnan in southwest China. Northwest Yunnan is one of the poorest regions in China, and since the 1990s, the Chinese government has legislated strong forest protection and fostered the growth of ecotourism-based economic development. We used Landsat TM/ETM+ and MSS images, Support Vector Machines, and a multi-temporal composite classification technique to analyze change in forest types and the loss of old-growth forest in three distinct periods of forestry policy and ecotourism development from 1974 to 2009. Our analysis showed that logging rates decreased substantially from 1974 to 2009, and the proportion of forest cover increased from 62\% in 1990 to 64\% in 2009. However, clearing of high-diversity old-growth forest accelerated, from approximately 1100 hectares/year before the logging ban (1990 to 1999), to 1550 hectares/year after the logging ban (1999 to 2009). Paradoxically, old-growth forest clearing accelerated most rapidly where ecotourism was most prominent. Despite increasing overall forest cover, the proportion of old-growth forests declined from 26\% in 1990, to 20\% in 2009. The majority of forests cleared from 1974 to 1990 returned to either a non-forested land cover type (14\%) or non-pine scrub forest (66\%) in 2009, and our results suggest that most non-pine scrub forest was not on a successional trajectory towards high-diversity forest stands. That means that despite increasing forest cover, biodiversity likely continues to decline, a trend obscured by simple forest versus non-forest accounting. It also means that rapid development may pose inherent risks to biodiversity, since our study area arguably represents a “best-case scenario” for balancing development with maintenance of biodiversity, given strong forest protection policies and an emphasis on ecotourism development.},

  abstract = {The estimation of fluvial sediment transport rate from measurements of morphological change has received growing recent interest. The revival of the ‘morphological method' reflects continuing concern over traditional methods of rate determination but also the availability of new survey methods capable of high-precision, high-resolution topographic monitoring. Remote sensing of river channels through aerial digital photogrammetry is a potentially attractive alternative to labour intensive ground surveys. However, while photogrammetry presents the opportunity to acquire survey data over large areas, data precision and accuracy, particularly in the vertical dimension are lower than in traditional ground survey methods. This paper presents results of recent research in which digital elevation models (DEMs) have been developed for a reach of a large braided gravel-bed river in Scotland using both digital photogrammetry and high-resolution RTK GPS ground surveys. A statistical level of change detection is assessed by comparing surfaces with independent check points. The methodological sensitivity of the annual channel sediment budget (1999–2000) to the threshold is presented. Results suggest that while the remote survey methods employed here can be used to develop qualitatively convincing, moderate precision DEMs of channel topography (RMSE=±0.21 m), the remaining errors imply significant limits on reliable change detection which lead to important information losses. Tests at a 95\% confidence interval for change detection show that over 60\% of channel deposition and 40\% of erosion may be obscured by the lower level of precision associated with photogrammetric monitoring when compared to ground survey measurements. This bias reflects the difficulty of detecting the topographic signature of widespread, but shallow deposition on bar tops.},

Their classification accuracy and the fact that they can be applied on virtually any kind of remote sensing data set are their key advantages. Especially researchers working with hyperspectral or other high dimensional datasets tend to favor SVMs as they suffer far less from the Hughes phenomenon than classifiers designed for multispectral datasets do. Due to these issues, numerous researchers have published a broad range of enhancements on SVM. Many of these enhancements aim at introducing probability distributions and the Bayes theorem. Within this paper, we present an assessment and comparison of classification results of the SVM and two enhancements-Import Vector Machines (IVM) and Relevance Vector Machines (RVM)-on simulated datasets of the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program EnMAP.},

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the corre- lation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth Interna- tional conference, ∗∗∗, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression. Keywords:},

However, the extent to which non-radiative mechanisms contribute to the local direct temperature response for different types of LCMC across the world remains uncertain. Here, we combine extensive records of remote sensing and in situ observation to show that non-radiative mechanisms dominate the local response in most regions for eight of nine common LCMC perturbations. We find that forest cover gains lead to an annual cooling in all regions south of the upper conterminous United States, northern Europe, and Siberia[mdash]reinforcing the attractiveness of re-/afforestation as a local mitigation and adaptation measure in these regions. Our results affirm the importance of accounting for non-radiative mechanisms when evaluating local land-based mitigation or adaptation policies.}

Firstly, the DSM pixels have been classified in order to previously detect any edges of the non-terrain feature. Then all the pixels corresponding to the ground, by means of a region growing algorithm, has been identified through a correction procedure. Finally, by a new interpolation on the classified ground pixel only, we can derive the digital terrain model.

  abstract = {LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) is one of the most recent technologies in surveying and mapping. LIDAR is based on the combination of three different data collection tools: a laser scanner mounted on an aircraft, a Global Positioning System (GPS) used in phase differential kinematic modality to provide the sensor position and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) to provide the orientation. The laser sends towards the ground an infrared signal, which is reflected back to the sensor. The time employed by the signal, given the aircraft position and attitude, allows computation of the earth point elevation. In standard conditions, taking into account the flight (speed 200–250 km/hour, altitude 500–2,000 m) and sensor characteristics (scan angle ± 10–20 degrees, emission rate 2,000–50,000 pulses per second), earth elevations are collected within a density of one point every 0.5–3 m. The technology allows us therefore to obtain very accurate (5–20 cm) and high resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM). For many applications, the Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is needed: we have to automatically detect and discard from the previous DSM all the features (buildings, trees, etc.) present on the terrain. This paper describes a procedure that has been implemented within GRASS to construct DTMs from LIDAR source data.},

In the past, mining operations frequently stood accused of being socially and environmentally disruptive, whereas mining today invests heavily in 'socially responsible' and 'sustainable' business practices. Changes such as these can be witnessed internationally as well as in places like Western Australia (WA), where the mining sector has matured into an economic pillar of the state, and indeed the nation in the context of the recent resources boom. This paper explores the role of mining in WA, presenting a multi-disciplinary perspective on the sector's contribution to sustainable development in the state. The perspectives offered here are drawn from community-based research and the associated academic literature as well as data derived from government sources and the not-for-profit sector. Findings suggest that despite noteworthy attitudinal and operational improvements in the industry, social, economic and environmental problem areas remain. As mining in WA is expected to grow in the years to come, these problem areas require the attention of business and government alike to ensure the long-term sustainability of development as well as people and place.

  abstract = {In 1983, the U.N. General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and Development, an independent committee of twenty-two members, headed by Gro Harlem Brundtland, the Prime Minister of Norway. Designed to examine global environment and development to the year 2000 and beyond, the commission seeks to reassess critical problems, to formulate realistic proposals for solving them, and to raise the level of understanding and commitment to the issues of environment and development. Rather than presenting a gloom and doom report about the destruction of natural resources, Our Common Future offers an agenda advocating the growth of economies based on policies that do not harm, and can even enhance, the environment. The commission recognizes that the time has come for a marriage of economy and ecology, in order to ensure the growth of human progress through development without bankrupting the resources of future generations.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a location model for the optimal organization of transplant system. Instead of simulation approach, which is typical when facing many health care applications, our approach is distinctively based on a mathematical programming formulation of the relevant problem. In particular, we focus on the critical role of time in transplantation process as well as on a spatial distribution of transplant centers. The allocation of transplantable organs across regions with the objective of attaining regional equity in health care, is the aim of this paper. Our model differs from previous modeling approaches in that it considers the nationwide reorganization of the transplant system, identifying system barriers that may impair equity and efficiency. The demolition of these barriers may leads on a reduction of waiting lists and of wasted organs. We provide the basic structure and the properties of the model, and validate it on a real case study. The experimental validation of the model demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of our proposal.},

  abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local form of spatial analysis introduced in 1996 in the geographical literature drawing from statistical approaches for curve-fitting and smoothing applications. The method works based on the simple yet powerful idea of estimating local models using subsets of observations centered on a focal point. Since its introduction, GWR rapidly captured the attention of many in geography and other fields for its potential to investigate nonstationary relations in regression analysis. The basic concepts have also been used to obtain local descriptive statistics and other models such as Poisson regression and probit. The method has been instrumental in highlighting the existence of potentially complex spatial relationships. At the same time, there have been a number of debates concerning the nature and range of applications of the method, including its use for inferential analysis or interpolation. The evidence available suggests that GWR is a useful, if imperfect, tool for inferring spatial processes, and a relatively simple and effective tool for spatial interpolation. Related technical developments enhance GWR (e.g., autocorrelation tests and multiple comparison adjustments) and/or complement it (e.g., the expansion method). Other approaches provide alternatives to the use of GWR (e.g., kriging and Bayesian models).},

  abstract = {Traditional assessment of heat-related health risks neglects the influence of the building physics as outdoor conditions are used as predictor variables. Data on heat-related mortality from Berlin, Germany and from the US are evaluated with a risk concept which differentiates between outdoor and indoor hazards. Such, the influence of non-linear building physics on heat-related risks can be considered and the impact of adaptation strategies can be examined. The number of heat-related deaths in the age-group 65+ for Berlin is expected to double with each 1K increase in ambient temperature. It can be reduced by 50\% with a mean ambient air-temperature reduction of 0.8K. Countermeasures to urban heat islands are evaluated according to their reduction potential on hazards, both indoors and outdoors. The analysis shows that classic UHI countermeasures, which are effective in reducing air-temperatures outdoors, do not necessarily reduce the indoor hazard. Regarding indoor heat-related hazards, trees, façade and roof greening, cool roofs and cool pavements have a low impact only. Measures at the building level, namely cool roofs and façade greening perform best, however, passive cooling and air-conditioning are most effective. To reduce the number of excess deaths in a changing climate, combined measures are necessary.},

  abstract = {A common obstacle to the use of remote sensing data for nature conservation is the difficulty in obtaining or generating data that are pre-processed to a standard that gives confidence in their subsequent use. Such processing is essential in order to facilitate physical measurement (e.g., of temperature, surface reflectance, height) and compare data (e.g., reflectance or radar backscatter) acquired for different dates or areas. For optical and radar data, this pre-processing includes orthorectification, calibration, atmospheric and topographic correction and, in the case of LiDAR, ground return classification and surface height retrieval. This chapter therefore provides an overview of the common pre-processing steps that are undertaken or needed in order to create what has been recently termed an analysis ready data (ARD) product. Increasingly, such products are being provided routinely to minimize the effort of data users but knowledge of how this is achieved is important in determining the integrity and understanding the use of the data. The information provided should help users to identify, select and use data with confidence or to perform their own processing of the raw data.},

  abstract = {The effects of tropospheric ozone on lung function and respiratory symptoms have been well documented at relatively high concentrations. However, previous investigations have failed to establish a clear association between tropospheric ozone and respiratory diseases severe enough to require hospitalization after controlling for climate, and with gaseous and particulate air pollution at the lower concentrations typically observed in Canada today. To determine if low levels of tropospheric ozone contribute to hospitalization for respiratory disease, air pollution data were compared to hospital admissions for 16 cities across Canada representing 12.6 million people. During the 3927-day period from April 1, 1981, to December 31, 1991, there were 720,519 admissions for which the principle diagnosis was a respiratory disease. After controlling for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, soiling index, and dew point temperature, the daily high hour concentration of ozone recorded 1 day previous to the date of admission was positively associated with respiratory admissions in the April to December period but not in the winter months. The relative risk for a 30 ppb increase in ozone varied from 1.043 (P ¡ 0.0001) to 1.024 (P = 0.0258) depending on the selection of covariates in the regression model and subset of cities examined. The association between ozone and respiratory hospitalizations varied among cities, with relative risks ranging from 1.000 to 1.088 after simultaneous covariate adjustment. Particulate matter and carbon monoxide were also positively associated with respiratory hospitalizations. These results suggest that ambient air pollution at the relatively low concentrations observed in this study, including tropospheric ozone, is associated with excess admissions to hospital for respiratory diseases in populations experiencing diverse climates and air pollution profiles.},

Here we examined the diurnal and sea- sonal characteristics of the Surface UHI in relation to land-cover properties in the Phoenix metropolitan region, located in the northern Sonoran desert, Arizona, USA. Surface temperature patterns derived from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer for two day-night pairs of imagery from the summer (June) and the autumn (October) seasons were analyzed. Although the urban core was generally warmer than the rest of the area (especially at night), no consistent trends were found along the urbanization gradient. October daytime data showed that most of the urbanized area acted as a heat sink. Temperature patterns also revealed intra- urban temperature differences that were as large as, A. Buyantuyev ? J.

Regres- sion analyses confirmed the important role of vege- tation (daytime) and pavements (nighttime) in explaining spatio-temporal variation of surface tem- peratures. While these variables appear to be the main drivers of surface temperatures, their effects on surface temperatures are mediated considerably by humans as suggested by the high correlation between daytime temperatures and median family income. At night, however, the neighborhood socio-economic status was a much less controlling factor of surface temperatures. Finally, this study utilized geographi- cally weighted regression which accounts for spa- tially varying relationships, and as such it is a more appropriate analytical framework for conducting research involving multiple spatial data layers with autocorrelated structures.},

  abstract = {Urban areas are heterogeneous. Transitions in architecture and building density, vegetation, economic activity, and culture can occur at the scale of city blocks. Ecologists have been criticized for treating the city as homoge- neous and urbanization as one-dimensional. To develop ecological understanding of integrated human–natural systems, the fine-scale heterogeneity of their built and natural components must be quantified. There have been calls for the integration of the biophysical and human components of systems, but here we provide a new tool to quantify this integrated heterogeneity by reconceptualizing urban land-use and land-cover classification approaches. This new tool, High Ecological Resolution Classification for Urban Landscapes and Environmental Systems (HERCULES), balances detail and efficiency and is flexible, allowing it to be used for interdisciplinary research, with ancillary datasets, and across urban systems.},

In particular, the employed video technology fosters greater self-awareness and a more accurate perception of skill levels, and enhances students' self-efficacy. The contextualised learning experience also enables students to better appreciate the relevance of oral communication to their future careers.

In the first stage of the study, we use SVMs for crop classification and analyze their performance in terms of efficiency and robustness, as compared to extensively used neural and fuzzy methods. Efficiency is assessed by evaluating accuracy and statistical differences in several scenes. Robustness is analyzed in terms of: (1) suitability to working conditions when a feature selection stage is not possible and (2) performance when different levels of Gaussian noise are introduced at their inputs. In the second stage of this work, we analyze the distribution of the support vectors (SVs) and perform sensitivity analysis on the best classifier in order to analyze the significance of the input spectral bands. For classification purposes, six hyperspectral images acquired with the 128-band HyMAP spectrometer during the DAISEX-1999 campaign are used. Six crop classes were labeled for each image. A reduced set of labeled samples is used to train the models, and the entire images are used to assess their performance. Several conclusions are drawn: (1) SVMs yield better outcomes than neural networks regarding accuracy, simplicity, and robustness; (2) training neural and neurofuzzy models is unfeasible when working with high-dimensional input spaces and great amounts of training data; (3) SVMs perform similarly for different training subsets with varying input dimension, which indicates that noisy bands are successfully detected; and (4) a valuable ranking of bands through sensitivity analysis is achieved.},

However, it is unclear how park characteristics affect the formation of a park cool island (PCI). In this study, PCI intensity values for 92 parks in Nagoya, Japan were obtained from ASTER land surface temperature (LST) products and then correlated to detailed and use information derived from high-spatial-resolution IKONOS satellite data. The results indicate that (1) the cooling effect depends on the park size and seasonal radiation condition, and park size is non-linearly correlated to PCI intensity; (2) PCI intensity is mainly determined by the area of tree and shrub inside the park as well as the park shape, and grass has negative impact on PCI formation. The park vegetation and shape index (PVSI) proposed here well predicted PCI intensity of selected parks. These findings can help urban planners to understand PCI formation and design cool parks to counteract UHI effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Studies after the MA are taking up new challenges in the basic science needed to assess, project, and manage flows of ecosystem services and effects on human well-being. Yet, our ability to draw general conclu- sions remains limited by focus on discipline-bound sectors of the full social–ecological system. At the same time, some polices and practices intended to improve ecosystem services and human well-being are based on untested assumptions and sparse information. The people who are affected and those who provide resources are increasingly asking for evidence that interventions improve eco- system services and human well-being. New research is needed that considers the full ensemble of processes and feedbacks, for a range of biophysical and social systems, to better understand and manage the dynamics of the relationship between humans and the ecosystems on which they rely. Such research will expand the capacity to address fundamental questions about complex social– ecological systems while evaluating assumptions of policies and practices intended to advance human well-being through improved ecosystem services.},

  abstract = {The need to monitor the Earth's surface over a range of spatial and temporal scales is fundamental in ecosystems planning and management. Change-Vector Analysis (CVA) is a bi-temporal method of change detection that considers the magnitude and direction of change vector. However, many multispectral applications do not make use of the direction component. The procedure most used to calculate the direction component using multiband data is the direction cosine, but the number of output direction cosine images is equal to the number of original bands and has a complex interpretation. This paper proposes a new approach to calculate the spectral direction of change, using the Spectral Angle Mapper and Spectral Correlation Mapper spectral-similarity measures. The chief advantage of this approach is that it generates a single image of change information insensitive to illumination variation. In this paper the magnitude component of the spectral similarity was calculated in two ways: as the standard Euclidean distance and as the Mahalanobis distance. In this test the best magnitude measure was the Euclidean distance and the best similarity measure was Spectral Angle Mapper. The results show that the distance and similarity measures are complementary and need to be applied together.},

We tested two different multi-temporal remote sensing datasets and techniques for mapping the urban transition. Using the Red River Delta of Vietnam as a case study, we compared supervised classification of dense time stacks of Landsat data with trend analyses of an annual series of night-time lights (NTL) data from the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). The results of each method were corroborated through qualitative and quantitative GIS analyses. We found that these two approaches can be used synergistically, combining the advantages of each to provide a fuller understanding of the urban transition at different spatial scales.},

In this paper we argue that this may be the result of an excessive concentration on the study of the American experience and the neglect of other urban contexts, and examine the recent process of urban growth against the background of urban compactness and extreme densification represented by the Barcelona Metropolitan Region (BMR). The comparison of two detailed land-cover maps of 1993 and 2000 shows a progressive transformation in the traditional urban character of the region. Lower urban densities, high losses of non-urban land covers, depopulation of the metropolitan inner core, an increasing importance of single housing or the expansion of transportation infrastructures confirm the generalization of the dispersed urban model. However, the presence of numerous medium sized towns has also proved to be a deterrent of excessive dispersion. In conclusion, polycentric metropolitan areas such as the BMR may be more adjusted to absorb the negative effects of dispersion than monocentric areas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

According to these operations, works in the literature are broken down into three parts: facility location, relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations. For the first two parts, the literature is structured and analyzed based on the model types, decisions, objectives, and constraints.

Based since 1973 at the School of Public Health of the Université Catholique de Louvain, Belgium, CRED became in 1980 a World Health Organization (WHO) collaboration centre. Since then, CRED has worked closely with United Nations agencies, inter-governmental and governmental institutions, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), research institutes and other universities. Disasters preparedness, mitigation and prevention for vulnerable populations have also gained a higher profile within CRED's activities in recent years. www.cred.be EM-DAT CRED's Emergency Events Database (EM-DAT) contains the world's most comprehensive data on the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 technological and natural disasters from 1900 to the present day. Created with the support of the WHO and the Belgian government, the main objective of EM-DAT is to inform humanitarian action at the national and international levels in order to improve decision-making in disaster preparedness, provide objective data for assessing communities' vulnerability to disasters and to help policy-makers set priorities. In 1999, a collaboration between the United States Agency for International Development's Office Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) and CRED was initiated. Since 2014, EM-DAT also georeferences natural disasters, adding geographical values to numeric data which is essential for deeper analysis. Details of EM-DAT's methodology and partner organizations can be found on our website www.emdat.be},

The proposed approach makes use of statistical properties of polarimetric data, and takes advantage of a fuzzy neural network. A distance measure, based on a complex Wishart distribution, is applied using the fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm, and the clustering result is then incorporated into the neural network. Instead of preselecting the polarization channels to form a feature vector, all elements of the polarimetric covariance matrix serve as the target feature vector as inputs to the neural network. It is thus expected that the neural network will include fully polarimetric backscattering information for image classification. With the generalization, adaptation, and other capabilities of the neural network, information contained in the covariance matrix, such as the amplitude, the phase difference, the degree of polarization, etc., can be fully explored. A test image, acquired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Airborne SAR (AIRSAR) system, is used to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. It is shown that the proposed approach can greatly enhance the adaptability and the flexibility giving fully polarimetric SAR for terrain cover classification. The integration of fuzzy c-means (FCM) and fast generalization dynamic learning neural network (DLNN) capabilities makes the proposed algorithm an attractive and alternative method for polarimetric SAR classification.},

  abstract = {Global warming has obtained more and more attention because the global mean surface temperature has increased since the late 19th century. As more than 50\% of the human population lives in cities, urbanization has become an important contributor for global warming. Pearl River Delta (PRD) in Guangdong Province, southern China, is one of the regions experiencing rapid urbanization that has resulted in remarkable Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect, which will be sure to influence the regional climate, environment, and socio-economic development. In this study, Landsat TM and ETM+ images from 1990 to 2000 in the PRD were selected to retrieve the brightness temperatures and land use/cover types. A new index, Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI), was proposed to extract bare land from the satellite images. Additionally, Shenzhen, which has experienced the fastest urbanization in Guangdong Province, was taken as an example to analyze the temperature distribution and changes within a large city as its size expanded in the past decade. Results show that the UHI effect has become more prominent in areas of rapid urbanization in the PRD region. The spatial distribution of heat islands has been changed from a mixed pattern, where bare land, semi-bare land and land under development were warmer than other surface types, to extensive UHI. Our analysis showed that higher temperature in the UHI was located with a scattered pattern, which was related to certain land-cover types. In order to analyze the relationship between UHI and land-cover changes, this study attempted to employ a quantitative approach in exploring the relationship between temperature and several indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) and Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI). It was found that correlations between NDVI, NDWI, NDBaI and temperature are negative when NDVI is limited in range, but positive correlation is shown between NDBI and temperature. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Compact cities, characterized by relative high density, mixed land-use and pedestrian-oriented habitation, have been proposed as one solution for sustainable urban planning. However, given the fact that Chinese cities are characterized by high population densities, the applicability of a more compact solution to expanding cities in China remains questionable. Essential to the decision-making is a deeper understanding about the relationship between urban compactness and the sustainable performance of the cities. This study is proposed for a quantitative evaluation about the costs and benefits of cities' compaction in Chinese context from environmental perspective, especially with respect to "facility availability, infrastructure efficiency, public transport, domestic energy and resources consumption and environmental externalities." 45 core Chinese cities are selected for the detailed illustration. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Important findings The population boom and rapid economic developments have greatly reduced mangrove areas in China since 1980s, leaving only 22 700 ha mangroves in mainland China in 2001. Chinese government has launched a series of programs to protect mangroves since 1980s and has established mangrove ecosystems as high-priority areas for improving environmental and living resource management. During last three decades, a total of 34 natural mangrove conservation areas have been established, which accounts for 80\% of the total existing mangroves areas in China. Mangrove restoration areas in Mainland China accounted for ¡7\% of the total mangroves areas in 2002. A great deal of research papers on Chinese mangroves has been published in international journals. However, more systematic protection strategies and active restoration measurements are still urgently needed in order to preserve these valuable resources in China.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—Previous findings of the association between socioeconomic deprivation (SED) and survival after stroke are inconsistent. There is less investigation on long-term survival. We assessed the associations in a multi-ethnic population in England. Methods—We examined data from 4398 patients (3103 whites, 932 blacks, and 253 Asians/others) with first-ever stroke, collected by a population-based stroke register in South London from 1995 to 2011. SED was measured using the Carstairs index score—the higher score, the more deprived. It was analyzed in multivariate Cox regression models in relation to survival after stroke. Results—During 17-year follow-up 2754 patients died. The quartile data of Carstairs score showed no significant association of SED with survival in patients, except for black Caribbeans and Africans. Black patients with the fourth quartile SED had a multivariate adjusted hazard ratio of 1.76 (95\% confidence interval, 1.06–2.94) for 3-month mortality and 1.54 (1.00–2.37) for 1-year mortality. After adjustment for acute stroke care provisions, these were no longer significant. However, the sextile data of Carstairs score showed a consistent association of SED with survival after stroke; all patients with the sixth sextile had a fully adjusted hazard ratio of 1.23 (1.05–1.44) for 3-month mortality and 1.13 (1.01–1.25) for 17-year mortality. Conclusions—There is a weak but significant association of SED with reduced survival after stroke in England. SED in blacks may have a stronger impact on short-term survival when compared with white patients. Further efforts are required to achieve equality in survival among patients with stroke of different socioeconomic groups.},

  abstract = {Soil moisture is crucial in regulating vegetation productivity and controlling terrestrial carbon uptake. This study aims to quantify the impact of soil moisture on vegetation at large spatial and long-term temporal scales using independent satellite observations. We used a newly developed satellite-derived soil moisture product and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to investigate the impact of soil moisture on vegetation across mainland Australia between 1991 and 2009. Our approach relied on multiple statistical methods including: (i) windowed cross correlation; (ii) quantile regression; (iii) piecewise linear regression. We found a strong positive relationship between soil moisture and NDVI, with NDVI typically lagging behind soil moisture by one month. The temporal characteristics of this relation show substantial regional variability. Dry regions with low vegetation density are more sensitive to soil moisture for the high end of the distribution of NDVI than moist regions, suggesting that soil moisture enhances vegetation growth in dry regions and in the early stage in wet regions. Using piecewise linear regression, we detected three periods with different soil moisture trends over the 19. years. The changes in NDVI trends are significant (p ¡ 0.01) with turning points of soil moisture in the beginning of 2000 and the end of 2002. Our findings illustrate the usefulness of the new soil moisture product by demonstrating the impacts of soil moisture on vegetation at various temporal scales. This analysis could be used as a benchmark for coupled vegetation climate models. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Global Land Cover (GLC) information is fundamental for environmental change studies, land resource management, sustainable development, and many other societal benefits. Although GLC data exists at spatial resolutions of 300. m and 1000. m, a 30. m resolution mapping approach is now a feasible option for the next generation of GLC products. Since most significant human impacts on the land system can be captured at this scale, a number of researchers are focusing on such products. This paper reports the operational approach used in such a project, which aims to deliver reliable data products.Over 10,000 Landsat-like satellite images are required to cover the entire Earth at 30. m resolution. To derive a GLC map from such a large volume of data necessitates the development of effective, efficient, economic and operational approaches. Automated approaches usually provide higher efficiency and thus more economic solutions, yet existing automated classification has been deemed ineffective because of the low classification accuracy achievable (typically below 65\%) at global scale at 30. m resolution. As a result, an approach based on the integration of pixel- and object-based methods with knowledge (POK-based) has been developed. To handle the classification process of 10 land cover types, a split-and-merge strategy was employed, i.e. firstly each class identified in a prioritized sequence and then results are merged together. For the identification of each class, a robust integration of pixel-and object-based classification was developed. To improve the quality of the classification results, a knowledge-based interactive verification procedure was developed with the support of web service technology. The performance of the POK-based approach was tested using eight selected areas with differing landscapes from five different continents. An overall classification accuracy of over 80\% was achieved. This indicates that the developed POK-based approach is effective and feasible for operational GLC mapping at 30. m resolution.},

A typical heat wave day in 2013 was selected to investigate the daytime radiant heat stress intensity. Spatial analysis modules were developed and the Radiant Heat Stress Intensity index was defined. The study reveals that in Shanghai under heat waves the heat stress induced by the thermal radiant environment is quite severe, with Tmrtcommonly well above 60 °C in daytime, and intra-urban Tmrtdifferences are largely influenced by building density and height, street orientation and vegetation. Open paved spaces and space near sunlit walls are the places that have the highest Tmrt. The study shows that the spatial variation of Tmrtcan be used to identify thermally vulnerable areas and hotspots in complex urban environment, and provide implications for urban design towards the mitigation of heat stress in high-density cities.},

A framework of stages and strategies is developed to analyze the rhetorical structure of lecture closings. Large and small classes are further compared to find how class size may influence the ways lecturers close their lectures. Personal pronouns I, you, and we are also examined to explore interpersonal dynamics. Results show that lecturers use a wide range of strategies in closings, yet with great variation. Three strategies-explicitly indicating the end of lecture, explaining course plans for the next class, and dismissing the class-are most frequently used. Large and small classes differ in both stages and strategies. Strategies tend to concentrate at the Ending Stage in large classes, but at the Pre-ending and Post-ending Stages in small classes. Interestingly, students and lecturers in small classes have frequent, informal interaction on non-course-related issues. Lecturers may use personal pronouns flexibly and strategically, referring to a variety of semantic referents, to enhance student engagement and mitigate potential disfavor. These findings demonstrate the impact of class size on lecture closings, which provide an opportunity for lecturers to establish close rapport with students. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Object detection in optical remote sensing images, being a fundamental but challenging problem in the field of aerial and satellite image analysis, plays an important role for a wide range of applications and is receiving significant attention in recent years. While enormous methods exist, a deep review of the literature concerning generic object detection is still lacking. This paper aims to provide a review of the recent progress in this field. Different from several previously published surveys that focus on a specific object class such as building and road, we concentrate on more generic object categories including, but are not limited to, road, building, tree, vehicle, ship, airport, urban-area. Covering about 270 publications we survey (1) template matching-based object detection methods, (2) knowledge-based object detection methods, (3) object-based image analysis (OBIA)-based object detection methods, (4) machine learning-based object detection methods, and (5) five publicly available datasets and three standard evaluation metrics. We also discuss the challenges of current studies and propose two promising research directions, namely deep learning-based feature representation and weakly supervised learning-based geospatial object detection. It is our hope that this survey will be beneficial for the researchers to have better understanding of this research field.},

The study employs land surface temperature (LST) data retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra (EOS AM-1) and Aqua (EOS PM-1) NASA satellites, between 2000 and 2012. Based on the Rodionov regime shift index, the significant changing points in the land surface temperature values along transverse profiles crossing the city's centre were considered as SUHI's limits. The thermal difference between the SUHI and several surrounding buffers defines the SUHI's intensity. The night-time SUHI's geometry is more regular, and its intensity is slightly lower than during the day, while the land cover exerts a strong influence on Bucharest's LST. In summary, the study proposes a methodology to delimit and quantify the average SUHI based on the statistical significance of the shift between the urban area and its surroundings, and the limitations of the method are mentioned. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

  abstract = {Many regions has been facing formidable freshwater management and planning challenges. Concerns about limited water allocations, conservation of environmental and water qualities and policies for sustainable water use have been increased because rising water demand would cause water shortage in the near future. Therefore, it is necessary to look into possible alternative water resources management plans to mitigate the potential water shortage. However, it is not straightforward to predict and analyze the various situations likely to be occurred in the future. Also, finding an optimal solution among many alternatives to mitigate the water shortage is a complex task. In this study, a methodology of predicting and analyzing the water resources situations in the future using the K-WEAP (Korea Water Evaluation and Planning system) is presented and an optimal alternative is determined using the MCDA (Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis) that takes into account the economic, environmental, and social sectors. The proposed methodology is applied to the Nakdong River basin in South Korea to calculate water budget and possible water shortage. An optimal water shortage mitigation policy for the study basin is also suggested to help decision maker develop long-term water resources management strategies.},

  abstract = {In this paper we provide an overview of various satellite products over the Sahara Desert that were available during the GERBILS field campaign. Our results indicate that all mid-visible satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) products match well with AERONET retrievals. For low AOD (AOD ¡ 1), the satellite AODs compare well with aircraft AOD values but they tend to underestimate at high AOD values. We then assessed the satellite products in 0.5 × 0.5 degree grids for the entire study region (10–30°N and 20°W–10°E). If we use a multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) as a benchmark for AOD retrievals over bright targets, the estimated AOD derived from the ozone-monitoring instrument aerosol index–MISR relationship performs best when compared with MISR for the entire study region. Although differences exist among satellite products, the advancement in satellite retrieval techniques now provide AOD retrievals over bright targets such as deserts, which are useful for numerical modeling simulation comparisons and other studies. Furthermore, the in situ information from aircraft and the ground continue to provide valuable information for validating satellite products and for assessing their strengths and weaknesses.

  abstract = {Background Access to cardiac services is essential for appropriate implementation of evidence-based therapies to improve outcomes. The Cardiac Accessibility and Remoteness Index for Australia (Cardiac ARIA) aimed to derive an objective, geographic measure reflecting access to cardiac services. Methods and Results An expert panel defined an evidence-based clinical pathway. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the team developed a numeric/alphabetic index at 2 points along the continuum of care. The acute category (numeric) measured the time from the emergency call to arrival at an appropriate medical facility via road ambulance. The aftercare category (alphabetic) measured access to 4 basic services (family doctor, pharmacy, cardiac rehabilitation, and pathology services) when a patient returned to his or her community. The numeric index ranged from 1 (access to principal referral center with cardiac catheterization service ≤1 hour) to 8 (no ambulance service, ¿3 hours to medical facility, air transport required). The alphabetic index ranged from A (all 4 services available within a 1-hour drive-time) to E (no services available within 1 hour). The panel found that 13.9 million Australians (71\%) resided within Cardiac ARIA 1A locations (hospital with cardiac catheterization laboratory and all aftercare within 1 hour).

Conclusions The Cardiac ARIA index demonstrated substantial inequity in access to cardiac services in Australia.

  abstract = {An experimental site was set up in a large, flat and homogeneous area of rice crops for the validation of satellite derived land surface temperature (LST). Experimental campaigns were held in the summers of 2002-2004, when rice crops show full vegetation cover. LSTs were measured radiometrically along transects covering an area of 1 km2. A total number of four thermal radiometers were used, which were calibrated and inter-compared through the campaigns. Radiometric temperatures were corrected for emissivity effects using field emissivity and downwelling sky radiance measurements. A database of ground-based LSTs corresponding to morning, cloud-free overpasses of Envisat/Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer (AATSR) and Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is presented. Ground LSTs ranged from 25 to 32°C, with uncertainties between ± 0.5 and ± 0.9°C. The largest part of these uncertainties was due to the spatial variability of surface temperature. The database was used for the validation of LSTs derived from the operational AATSR and MODIS split-window algorithms, which are currently used to generate the LST product in the L2 level data. A quadratic, emissivity dependent split-window equation applicable to both AATSR and MODIS data was checked as well. Although the number of cases analyzed is limited (five concurrences for AATSR and eleven for MODIS), it can be concluded that the split-window algorithms work well, provided that the characteristics of the area are adequately prescribed, either through the classification of the land cover type and the vegetation cover, or with the surface emissivity. In this case, the AATSR LSTs yielded an average error or bias of - 0.9°C (ground minus algorithm), with a standard deviation of 0.9°C. The MODIS LST product agreed well with the ground LSTs, with differences comparable or smaller than the uncertainties of the ground measurements for most of the days (bias of + 0.1°C and standard deviation of 0.6°C, for cloud-free cases and viewing angles smaller than 60°). The quadratic split-window algorithm resulted in small average errors (+ 0.3°C for AATSR and 0.0°C for MODIS), with differences not exceeding ± 1.0°C for most of the days (standard deviation of 0.9°C for AATSR and 0.5°C for MODIS). © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

For the Valencia site, ground LST measurements were compared with the MOD11\textsubscript{L}2 product in the conventional temperature-based (T-based) method. We also applied the alternative radiance-based (R-based) method, with in situ LSTs calculated from brightness temperatures in band 31 through radiative transfer simulations using temperature and water vapor profiles and surface emissivity data. At the Valencia site, profiles were obtained from local radiosonde measurements and from National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) data. The R-based method was applied at the Hainich site using radiosonde profiles from a nearby sounding station and NCEP profiles. The T-based validation showed average bias ( MODIS minus ground) of -0.3 K, standard deviation of 0.6 K and root mean square error (RMSE) of +/- 0.7 K. For the R-based method, the quality of the atmospheric profiles was assessed through the difference delta(T-31-T-32) between the actual MODIS and the profile-based calculated brightness temperature difference in bands 31 and 32. For the cases where -0.3 K ¡ delta(T-31-T-32) ¡ 0.5 K, the R-based method yielded LST errors with small biases and RMSE = +/- 0.6 K for the two sites. These results show the high accuracy and precision of the MODIS LST product for the two sites studied. The good performance of the R-based method opens the possibility for a more complete validation including heterogeneous surfaces where the T-based method is not feasible.},

  abstract = {Forest fires are a serious management challenge in many regions, complicating the appropriate allocation to suppression and prevention efforts. Using a System Dynamics (SD) model, this paper explores how interactions between physical and political systems in forest fire management impact the effectiveness of different allocations. A core issue is that apparently sound management can have unintended consequences. An instinctive management response to periods of worsening fire severity is to increase fire suppression capacity, an approach with immediate appeal as it directly treats the symptom of devastating fires and appeases the public. However, the SD analysis indicates that a policy emphasizing suppression can degrade the long-run effectiveness of forest fire management. By crowding out efforts to preventative fuel removal, it exacerbates fuel loads and leads to greater fires, which further balloon suppression budgets. The business management literature refers to this problem as the firefighting trap, wherein focus on fixing problems diverts attention from preventing them, and thus leads to inferior outcomes. The paper illustrates these phenomena through a case study of Portugal, showing that a balanced approach to suppression and prevention efforts can mitigate the self-reinforcing consequences of this trap, and better manage long-term fire damages. These insights can help policymakers and fire managers better appreciate the interconnected systems in which their authorities reside and the dynamics that may undermine seemingly rational management decisions.},

  abstract = {Today, validation or accuracy assessment is an integral component of most mapping projects incorporating remotely sensed data. Other spatial information may not be so stringently evaluated, but at least requires meta-data that documents how the information was generated. This emphasis on data quality was not always the case. In the 1970s only a few brave scientists and researchers dared ask the question, ‘How good is this map derived from Landsat MSS imagery?' In the 1980s, the use of the error matrix became a common tool for representing the accuracy of individual map categories. By the 1990s, most maps derived from remotely sensed imagery were required to meet some minimum accuracy standard. A similar progression can be outlined for other spatial information. However, this progression is about 5 years behind the validation of remotely sensed data. This paper presents a series of steps moving towards better assessment and validation of spatial information and asks the reader to evaluate where they are in this series and to move forward.}

  abstract = {Cognitive and learning styles (CLS) have long been investigated as a basis to adapt instruction and enhance learning. Web-based learning (WBL) can reach large, heterogenous audiences, and adaptation to CLS may increase its effectiveness. Adaptation is only useful if some learners (with a defined trait) do better with one method and other learners (with a complementary trait) do better with another method (aptitude-treatment interaction). A comprehensive search of health professions education literature found 12 articles on CLS in computer-assisted learning and WBL. Because so few reports were found, research from nonmedical education was also included. Among all the reports, four CLS predominated. Each CLS construct was used to predict relationships between CLS and WBL. Evidence was then reviewed to support or refute these predictions. The wholist-analytic construct shows consistent aptitude-treatment interactions consonant with predictions (wholists need structure, a broad-before-deep approach, and social interaction, while analytics need less structure and a deep-before-broad approach). Limited evidence for the active-reflective construct suggests aptitude-treatment interaction, with active learners doing better with interactive learning and reflective learners doing better with methods to promote reflection. As predicted, no consistent interaction between the concrete-abstract construct and computer format was found, but one study suggests that there is interaction with instructional method. Contrary to predictions, no interaction was found for the verbal-imager construct. Teachers developing WBL activities should consider assessing and adapting to accommodate learners defined by the wholist-analytic and active-reflective constructs. Other adaptations should be considered experimental. Further WBL research could clarify the feasibility and effectiveness of assessing and adapting to CLS.

  abstract = {Considerable effort has been devoted over the years to fighting uncertainty in geographic information in its different manifestations. Thus far, research on handling inaccuracy, fuzziness, error and related issues has focused for the most part on problems with spatial data and their direct products, typically representations of spatial objects or fields. This paper seeks to broaden the discussion of uncertainty in the geospatial domain by shifting the focus from information to knowledge. It turns out that there is a surprising number of things that we cannot know (or questions we cannot answer) that are not the result of imperfect information. Forms of not knowing are pervasive in domains as diverse as mathematics, logic, physics, and linguistics, and are apparently irreducible. This being the case it may help to explore how these realms of ignorance may affect our efforts. The paper distinguishes three different modes or forms of geospatial knowledge production, and argues that each of them has built–in imperfections, for reasons of logical principle and not just empirical fact. While much can and needs to be done to manage and resolve uncertainties where possible, I argue for accepting that uncertainty is an intrinsic property of complex knowledge and not just a flaw that needs to be excised.},

  abstract = {A novel approach to image radiometric normalization for change detection is presented. The approach referred to as stratified relative radiometric normalization (SRRN) uses a time-series of imagery to stratify the landscape for localized radiometric normalization. The goal is to improve the detection accuracy of abrupt land cover changes (human-induced, natural disaster, etc.) while decreasing false detection of natural vegetation changes that are not of interest. These vegetation changes may be associated with such phenomena as phenology, growth and stress (e.g. drought), which occur at varying spatial and temporal scales, depending on landscape position, vegetation type, season, precipitation history and historic episodes of local disturbance. The SRRN approach was tested for a study area on the Californian border between the USA and Mexico using Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus satellite imagery. Change products were generated from imagery radiometrically normalized using the SRRN procedure and with imagery normalized using a traditional empirical line technique. Reference data derived from high spatial resolution airborne imagery were utilized to validate the two change products. The SRRN procedure provided several benefits and was found to improve the overall accuracy of detecting abrupt land cover changes by nearly 20\%.}

Hence, there is much scope for the application of MLAs to the rapidly increasing volumes of remotely sensed geophysical data for geological mapping problems. We carry out a rigorous comparison of five MLAs: Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Artificial Neural Networks, in the context of a supervised lithology classification task using widely available and spatially constrained remotely sensed geophysical data.Wemake a further comparison ofMLAs based on their sensitivity to variations in the degree of spatial clustering of training data, and their response to the inclusion of explicit spatial information (spatial coordinates). Our work identifies Random Forests as a good first choice algorithm for the supervised classificationof lithology using remotely sensedgeophysical data.RandomForests is straightforward totrain, computationally efficient, highly stable with respect to variations in classification model parameter values, andasaccurate as, orsubstantiallymore accuratethantheotherMLAs trialed.Theresultsofour studyindicate that as training data becomes increasingly dispersed across the region under investigation, MLA predictive accuracy improves dramatically. The use of explicit spatial information generates accurate lithology predictions but should be used in conjunction with geophysical data in order to generate geologically plausible predictions. MLAs, such as Random Forests, are valuable tools for generating reliable first-pass predictions for practical geological mapping applications that combine widely available geophysical data},

It has already proven useful in the agenda-setting workshops in cities across the globe that are participating in the 100 Resilient Cities Challenge. These workshops, in turn, have helped and will continue to help shape the framework and contribute to the final phase, developing the indicators and variables that will comprise the City Resilience Index. This framework will form the basis of a tool that should enable all of us interested in city resilience to convene around a common understanding of that idea, and begin to ‘baseline' what matters most for making cities more resilient. Both the framework and the index are intended to facilitate a process of engagement with and within cities that generates dialogue and deeper understanding. Ultimately, this will lead to new ideas and opportunities to engage new actors in civil society, government and business on what makes a city resilient.},

Loss in undeveloped land-use was measured using standardized change detection of Landsat green vegetation and albedo fractions.

The area of undeveloped land-use loss was 81\% greater in forest than agricultural land-use during the bubble and only 51\% greater, post-bubble. Undeveloped urban forest loss constituted 25\% of all losses during the bubble, while during the bust it was 42\%.

The concept is described, and then the article focuses on the operational detail needed to progress towards fuller integration between the transport network and the city it serves. This includes analysis of urban structure in the context of the factors that influence efficient use of public transport: including residential density, intensity of activity and the hierarchy of activity centres. The implications for road planning are discussed where land use–transport integration is the core objective rather than simply traffic efficiency. If sustainable travel is to be facilitated there is a need to change both the operation of public transport and the urban structure and these changes are mutually supportive.},

Designing a transport system to compete with the car in a low-density city has raised significant challenges. The planning and routing of Perth's newest passenger railway has been strongly grounded in land use planning with active pursuit of opportunities for transit-oriented development (TOD). This has resulted in different models of integration from TODs designed around walk-on patronage, to TODs designed to calm hostile car-based environments, to transit-transfer stations relying on state transit agency coordination between transport modes to maximize the attractiveness of the public transport travel. This paper examines the opportunities and constraints presented by each model.},

  abstract = {The sustainable use and management of important tropical coastal ecosystems (mangrove forests, seagrass beds and coral reefs) cannot be done without understanding the direct and indirect impacts of man. The ecosystem's resilience and recovery capacity following such impacts must be determined. The efficacy of mitigation measures must also be considered. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are excellent tools to use in such studies. This paper reviews the state of the art and application of these tools in tropical coastal zones, and illustrates their relevance in sustainable development. It highlights a selected number of remote sensing case-studies on land cover patterns, population structure and dynamics, and stand characteristics from South-East Asia, Africa and South-America, with a particular emphasis on mangroves. It further shows how remote sensing technology and other scientific tools can be integrated in long-term studies, both retrospective and predictive, in order to anticipate degradation and to take mitigating measures at an early stage. The paper also highlights the guidelines for sustainable management that can result from remote sensing and GIS studies, and identifies existent gaps and research priorities. There is a need for more comprehensive approaches that deal with new remote sensing technologies and analysis in a GIS-environment, and that integrate findings collected over longer periods with the aim of prediction. It is also imperative to collect and integrate data from different disciplines. These are essential in the spirit of sustainable development and management, particularly in developing countries, which are often more vulnerable to environmental degradation.},

  abstract = {Transpiration is generally assumed to be insignificant at night when stomata close in response to the lack of photosynthetically active radiation. However, there is increasing evidence that the stomata of some species remain open at night, which would allow for nighttime transpiration if there were a sufficient environmental driving force. We examined nighttime water use in co-occurring species in a mixed deciduous stand at Harvard Forest, MA, using whole-tree and leaf-level measurements. Diurnal whole-tree water use was monitored continuously with Granier-style sap flux sensors in paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.), red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.). An analysis was conducted in which nighttime water flux could be partitioned between refilling of internal water stores and transpiration. Substantial nighttime sap flux was observed in all species and much of this flux was attributed to the refilling of depleted water stores. However, in paper birch, nighttime sap flux frequently exceeded recharge estimates. Over 10\% of the total daily sap flux during the growing season was due to transpiration at night in paper birch. Nighttime sap flux was over 8\% of the total daily flux in red oak and 2\% in red maple; however, this flux was mainly associated with recharge. On nights with elevated vapor pressure deficit, sap flux continued through the night in paper birch, whereas it reached zero during the night in red oak and red maple. Measurements of leaf-level gas exchange on a night with elevated vapor pressure deficit showed stomatal conductance dropping by only 25\% in paper birch, while approaching zero in red oak and red maple. The study highlighted differences in ecophysiological controls on sap flux exerted by co-occurring species. Paper birch is a fast-growing, shade-intolerant species with an earlier successional status than red oak and red maple. Risking water loss through nighttime transpiration may provide paper birch with an ecological advantage by enabling the species to maximize photosynthesis and support rapid growth. Nighttime transpiration may also be a mechanism for delivering oxygen to respiring cells in the deep sapwood of paper birch.},

Several experiments carried out on a complex forest area in Italy provide interesting conclusions on the effectiveness and potentialities of the joint use of hyperspectral and LIDAR data and on the accuracy of the different classification techniques analyzed in the proposed system. In particular, the elevation channel of the first LIDAR return was very effective for the separation of species with similar spectral signatures but different mean heights, and the SVM classifier proved to be very robust and accurate in the exploitation of the considered multisource data.},

  abstract = {The process of road extraction from high-resolution satellite images is complex, and most researchers have shown results on a few selected set of images. Based on the satellite data acquisition sensor and geolocation of the region, the type of processing varies and users tune several heuristic parameters to achieve a reasonable degree of accuracy. We exploit two salient features of roads, namely, distinct spectral contrast and locally linear trajectory, to design a multistage framework to extract roads from high-resolution multispectral satellite images. We trained four Probabilistic Support Vector Machines separately using four different categories of training samples extracted from urban/suburban areas. Dominant Singular Measure is used to detect locally linear edge segments as potential trajectories for roads. This complimentary information is integrated using an optimization framework to obtain potential targets for roads. This provides decent results in situations only when the roads have few obstacles (trees, large vehicles, and tall buildings). Linking of disjoint segments uses the local gradient functions at the adjacent pair of road endings. Region part segmentation uses curvature information to remove stray nonroad structures. Medial-Axis-Transform-based hypothesis verification eliminates connected nonroad structures to improve the accuracy in road detection. Results are evaluated with a large set of multispectral remotely sensed images and are compared against a few state-of-the-art methods to validate the superior performance of our proposed method.},

Fourteen design elements or decision points are identified that make one rubric different from another.

  abstract = {The effects of streets on biodiversity is an important aspect of urban ecology, but it has been neglected worldwide. Several vegetation attributes (e.g. street tree density and diversity) have important effects on biodiversity and ecological processes. In this study, we evaluated the influences of urban vegetation—represented by characteristics of street trees (canopy size, proportion of native tree species and tree species richness)—and characteristics of the landscape (distance to parks and vegetation quantity), and human impacts (human popula-tion size and exposure to noise) on taxonomic data and functional diversity indices of the bird community inhabiting streets. The study area was the southern region of Belo Horizonte (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a largely urbanized city in the understudied Neotropical region. Bird data were collected on 60 point count locations distributed across the streets of the land-scape. We used a series of competing GLM models (using Akaike's information criterion for small sample sizes) to assess the relative contribution of the different sets of variables to explain the observed patterns. Seventy-three bird species were observed exploiting the streets: native species were the most abundant and frequent throughout this landscape. The bird community's functional richness and Rao's Quadratic Entropy presented values lower than 0.5. Therefore, this landscape was favoring few functional traits. Exposure to noise was the most limiting factor for this bird community. However, the average size of arboreal patches and, especially the characteristics of street trees, were able to reduce the negative effects of noise on the bird community. These results show the importance of adequately planning the urban afforestation process: increasing tree species richness, pre-serving large trees and planting more native trees species in the streets are management practices that will increase bird species richness, abundance and community functional aspects and consequently improve human wellbeing and quality of life.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have identified associations between the surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect (i.e., SUHI, hereinafter is referred to as UHI) and urban growth, particularly changes in land cover patterns. This research questions their causal links to answer a key policy question: If cities restrict urban expansion and encourage people to live within existing urban areas, will that help in controlling UHI? The question has been answered by estimating four models using data from Brisbane, Australia: Model 1—cross-sectional ordinary least square (OLS) regression—to examine the association between the UHI effect and land cover patterns in 2013; Model 2—cross-sectional geographically weighted regression (GWR)—to examine whether the outputs generated from Model 1 possess significant spatial variations; Model 3—longitudinal OLS—to examine whether changes in land cover patterns led to changes in UHI effects between 2004 and 2013; and Model 4—longitudinal GWR—to examine whether the outputs generated from Model 3 vary significantly over space. All estimations were controlled for potential confounding effects (e.g., population, employment and dwelling densities). Results from the cross-sectional OLS and GWR models were consistent with previous findings and showed that porosity is negatively associated with the UHI effect in 2013. In contrast, population density has a positive association. Results from the longitudinal OLS and GWR models confirm their causal linkages and showed that an increase in porosity level reduced the UHI effect, whereas an increase in population density increased the UHI effect. The findings suggest that even a containment of population growth within existing urban areas will lead to the UHI effect. However, this can be significantly minimized through proper land use planning, by creating a balance between urban and non-urban uses of existing urban areas.},

Similarly, a second point worth discussing is to what extent multiangle SAR data allows extracting complementary urban features, exploiting different acquisition geometries. To these aims, in this paper, we show results on the same urban test site (Pavia, northern Italy), referring to a sequence of European Remote Sensing Satellite 1/2 (ERS-1/2) C-band images and to a set of simulated X-band data with a finer spatial resolution and different viewing angles. In particular, the multitemporal data is analyzed by means of a novel procedure based on a neuro-fuzzy classifier whose input is a subset of the ERS sequence chosen using the histogram distance index. Instead, the multiangle dataset is used to provide a better characterization of the road network in the area, overcoming effects due to the orientation of the SAR sensor.},

After defining the relevant spatial and geographic scales of interest, different procedures are proposed to disaggregate coarse-resolution data, to map them, and if necessary to infer missing data by using proxies. We discuss the advantages and limitations of these methodologies and detail the potentials of utilizing remote-sensing data. The latter is used especially to homogenize an existing coarser dataset and, where possible, replace it with detailed information extracted from remote sensing using the built-up indicators for different environments. Present research shows that the spatial aspects of earthquake risk computation are tightly connected with the availability of datasets of the resolution necessary for producing sufficiently detailed exposure. The global exposure database designed by the GED4GEM project is able to manage datasets and queries of multiple spatial scales.},

  abstract = {This study aims to compare, on the one hand, the geographical distribution of the desert dust source areas, their contribution to quantities emitted into the atmosphere, the trajectories and the quantities deposited, with on the other hand the areas of research interest focused on the desert dust impacts on air quality and/or human health. Based on a systematic review of the literature using the ISI Web of Knowledge database, we found 231 articles published over the last decade on the desert dust impacts on air quality. Of these, 48\% concerned Asian dust and 39\% Saharan dust, with the remaining 13\% divided between the other dust source areas. However, only one of these studies addressed the worsening air pollution in West Africa, even though it is very close to the Sahara, the greatest contributor to the global dust budget. Moreover, there have been very few studies (41) looking at the direct links between desert dust and human health; in this context too, no interest has been shown in West Africa. Yet this region is also among the areas in which morbidity rates have been noted to be far higher than those found in other regions of the world, and where respiratory infections alone account for more than 20\% of the causes of infant mortality. This survey highlights a clear imbalance between those areas most exposed to dust and the most studied areas in terms of dust impacts. Given these findings and the often alarming results published about other regions of the world, we advocate a revival of interest in research on West Africa in order to achieve a better understanding of the desert dust impacts on air quality and health among the populations of this region.},

Based on a systematic literature review, this paper aims to learn more about the relationship between desert dust and human health in the world and to analyse the place of West Africa as a study area of interest. Papers focussing on the potential relationship between dust and health and showing quantitative analyses, published between January 1999 and September 2011, were identified using the ISI Web of Knowledge database (N = 50). A number of adverse health effects, including respiratory, cardiovascular and cardiopulmonary diseases, are associated with dust. This survey highlights obvious dust impacts on human health independently of the study area, health outcomes and method. Moreover, it reveals an imbalance between the areas most exposed to dust and the areas most studied in terms of health effects. None of these studies has been conducted in West Africa, despite the proximity of the Sahara, which produces about half of the yearly global mineral dust. In view of the alarming results in many parts of the world (Asia, Europe, America), this paper concludes by stressing the importance of carrying out impact studies of Saharan dust in West Africa, where dust events are more frequent and intense than anywhere else.},

  abstract = {Very often, the only reliable information available to perform change detection is the description of some “unchanged” regions. Since, sometimes, these regions do not contain all the relevant information to identify their counterpart (the changes), we consider the use of unlabeled data to perform semi-supervised novelty detection (SSND). SSND can be seen as an unbalanced classification problem solved using the cost-sensitive support vector machine (CS-SVM), but this requires a heavy parameter search. Here, we propose the use of entire solution path algorithms for the CS-SVM in order to facilitate and accelerate parameter selection for SSND. Two algorithms are considered and evaluated. The first algorithm is an extension of the CS-SVM algorithm that returns the entire solution path in a single optimization. This way, optimization of a separate model for each hyperparameter set is avoided. The second algorithm forces the solution to be coherent through the solution path, thus producing classification boundaries that are nested (included in each other). We also present a low-density (LD) criterion for selecting optimal classification boundaries, thus avoiding recourse to cross validation (CV) that usually requires information about the “change” class. Experiments are performed on two multitemporal change detection data sets (flood and fire detection). Both algorithms tracing the solution path provide similar performances than the standard CS-SVM while being significantly faster. The proposed LD criterion achieves results that are close to the ones obtained by CV but without using information about the changes.},

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a central parameter for surface urban heat island (SUHI) studies, in which thermal remote sensing plays a key role. Traditionally, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), percent green vegetation (\%GV), and percent impervious surface area (\%ISA), have been widely applied to examine the impacts of land cover compositions on SUHI. Urban thermal pattern, however, is a complicated physical phenomenon involving a series of environmental factors, and it is insufficient to employ only one indicator for the explanation of the SUHI phenomenon. Therefore, considering different thermal properties of various land cover compositions, this study proposed a two-step physically based method, the spectral unmixing and thermal mixing (SUTM) model, to examine the impacts of typical land cover compositions on urban thermal pattern. The performance of SUTM was compared with those of linear and non-linear (quadratic) regression models with NDVI, \%GV, and \%ISA as individual independent variables. Results indicate that SUTM outperforms all regression models, with the lowest root mean square error (2.89. K) and mean absolute error (2.11. K). Moreover, when the accuracy was assessed at five interval levels of percent impervious surface area, it indicates that SUTM performs consistently well in both rural and urban areas. Comparatively, NDVI and \%GV-based regression models perform well in rural areas, but poor in urban areas, whereas \%ISA-based models perform well in urban areas, but relatively poor in rural areas. This study found that soil, including both moist and dry soil, has significant impacts on modeling SUHI. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The benefits have been explored by analyzing differences between the two site selection processes. One is a so-called official site selection process, which is implemented by the Agency for radwaste management (ARAO); the other is an optimization process suggested by experts working in the area of environmental impact assessment (EIA) and land-use (spatial) planning. The criteria on which the comparison of the results of the two site selection processes has been based are spatial organization, environmental impact, safety in terms of potential exposure of the population to radioactivity released from the repository, and feasibility of the repository from the technical, financial/economic and social point of view (the latter relates to consent by the local community for siting the repository). The site selection processes have been compared with the support of the decision expert system named DEX. The results of the comparison indicate that the sites selected by ARAO meet fewer suitability criteria than those identified by applying strategic environmental considerations in the framework of the optimization process. This result stands when taking into account spatial, environmental, safety and technical feasibility points of view.

  abstract = {Tectonics and earthquake occurrence processes of the two Himalayan syntaxes are complex. Their limited accessibility has restricted seismological investigations in these regions, resulting in poor knowledge about the geodynamic processes. Here, we provide Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of crustal deformation across the frontal eastern Himalayan syntaxis (EHS). In this region, the Indian plate obliquely underthrusts the Eurasian plate, and the eastward‐extruding Tibetan plateau moves around the EHS due to India–Eurasia convergence. Our GPS measurements in the region suggest that the frontal EHS accommodates at least ∼20 mm/yr of oblique convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates. Under the frontal EHS, on which this convergence is accommodated through a stick‐and‐slip process, the 65 km wide main thrust zone of the plate boundary interface currently is locked. These measurements and the limited information about the great 1950 Assam earthquake (Mw 8.6) suggest that this great earthquake probably occurred in the EHS.},

Spatial and temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes were quantified using three Landsat images, a supervised classification algorithm and the post-classification change detection technique in GIS. Accuracy of the Landsat-derived land use/cover maps ranged from 85 to 90\%. The analysis revealed that substantial growth of built-up areas in Greater Dhaka over the study period resulted significant decrease in the area of water bodies, cultivated land, vegetation and wetlands. Urban land expansion has been largely driven by elevation, population growth and economic development. Rapid urban expansion through infilling of low-lying areas and clearing of vegetation resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including habitat quality. As reliable and current data are lacking for Bangladesh, the land use maps produced in this study will contribute to both the development of sustainable urban land use planning decisions and also for forecasting possible future changes in growth patterns. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the roles of CRES within the team was to describe simplified parameters for the use of vegetation in the urban context, which can eventually be used irrespective of site-specific characteristics for different climatic contexts and urban textures. Of particular interest is the effect of vegetation on microclimate: thermal effects, as well as the effect of vegetation on solar and daylight access. These affect the microclimate of the existing open spaces as well as the energy use of the surrounding buildings for heating, cooling and lighting, through shading, evapotranspiration, etc. Simple parametric studies were examined, to identify the thermal impact of vegetation in the urban environment, at the scale of the urban block, particularly as far as the reduction of air temperature is concerned. ?? 2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

Several attempts have already been made to link existing analytical software to various GISs. However, a problem with all of these attempts is that the user is forced to switch back and forth between the GIS operating environment and the analytical software. In this paper we present a Statistical Analysis Module, SAM, that runs totally within the operating environment of a GIS and utilizes a command structure that makes running the package transparent to the user of the GIS. We believe that the development of this module is an important step in linking spatial analysis with GIS technology.}

  abstract = {Land use/land cover (LULC) change occurs when humans alter the landscape, and this leads to increasing loss, fragmentation and spatial simplification of habitat. Many fields of study require monitoring of LULC change at a variety of scales. LULC change assessment is dependent upon high-quality input data, most often from remote sensing-derived products such as thematic maps. This research compares pixel- and object-based classifications of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for mapping and analysis of LULC change in the mixed land use region of eastern Ontario for the period 1995–2005. For single date thematic maps of 10 LULC classes, quantitative and visual analyses showed no significant accuracy difference between the two methods. The object-based method produced thematic maps with more uniform and meaningful LULC objects, but it suffered from absorption of small rare classes into larger objects and the incapability of spatial parameters (e.g. object shape) to contribute to class discrimination. Despite the similar map accuracies produced by the two methods, temporal change maps produced using post-classification comparison (PCC) and analysed using intensive visual analysis of errors of omission and commission revealed that the object-based maps depicted change more accurately than maximum likelihood classification (MLC)-derived change maps.}

  abstract = {Situated over the Himalayan tectonic zone, Kathmandu Valley as a lake in geological past has a long history of destructive earthquakes. In recent years, the earthquake risk of the valley has significantly increased due mainly to uncontrolled development, poor construction practices with no earthquake safety consideration, and lack of awareness among the general public and government authorities. Implementation of land use plan and building codes, strengthening of design and construction regulations, relocation of communities in risky areas, and conduction of public awareness programs are suitable means of earthquake disaster risk management practice. Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal, is still lacking earthquake disaster risk management plans. So, this paper highlights some initiatives adopted by both governmental and nongovernmental organizations of Nepal to manage earthquake disaster risk in the Kathmandu Valley. It provides some comprehensive information on recent initiatives of earthquake disaster risk management in the valley and also highlights the outcomes and challenges.},

  abstract = {The non-structural assessment of critical public facilities such as hospital buildings is very essential for earthquake disaster adaptation in earthquake prone regions. In Nepal, a devastating earthquake is inevitable in the long term and likely in the near future. So a non-structural earthquake vulnerability assessment study was carried out in the selected main hospitals of Nepal. This paper presents the findings of the assessment work. The results show an alarming situation and demand an immediate action in most of the hospital buildings so as to achieve a standard and acceptable level of safety. The study also recommends a gradual approach of increasing the safety level considering the socio-economic condition of the country and the fact that medium-level earthquakes are more frequent than the severe ones. Moreover, the non-structural component assessment study largely helped to convince the government officials and hospital authorities on the affordability and possibility of constructing earthquake-resistant non-structural components in the hospitals of developing countries such as Nepal, employing a slight improvement in the already employed methods of construction.}

The role in this greening of the “CO2 fertilization” effect—the enhancement of photosynthesis due to rising CO2 levels—is yet to be established. The direct CO2 effect on vegetation should be most clearly expressed in warm, arid environments where water is the dominant limit to vegetation growth. Using gas exchange theory, we predict that the 14\% increase in atmospheric CO2 (1982–2010) led to a 5 to 10\% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments. Satellite observations, analyzed to remove the effect of variations in precipitation, show that cover across these environments has increased by 11\%. Our results confirm that the anticipated CO2 fertilization effect is occurring alongside ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle and that the fertilization effect is now a significant land surface process.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To compare the extent to which late 20th century patterns of mortality in London are predicted by contemporary patterns of poverty and by late 19th century patterns of poverty. To test the hypothesis that the pattern of mortality from causes known to be related to deprivation in early life can be better predicted by the distribution of poverty in the late 19th century than by that in the late 20th century. Design: Data from Charles Booth's survey of inner London in 1896 were digitised and matched to contemporary local government wards. Ward level indices of relative poverty were derived from Booth's survey and the 1991 UK census of population. All deaths which took place within the surveyed area between 1991 and 1995 were identified and assigned to contemporary local government wards. Standardised mortality ratios for various causes of death were calculated for each ward for all ages, under age 65, and over age 65. Simple correlation and partial correlation analysis were used to estimate the contribution of the indices of poverty from 1896 and 1991 in predicting ward level mortality ratios in the early 1990s. Setting: Inner London. Results: For many causes of death in London, measures of deprivation made around 1896 and 1991 both contributed strongly to predicting the current spatial distribution. Contemporary mortality from diseases which are known to be related to deprivation in early life (stomach cancer, stroke, lung cancer) is predicted more strongly by the distribution of poverty in 1896 than that in 1991. In addition, all cause mortality among people aged over 65 was slightly more strongly related to the geography of poverty in the late 19th century than to its contemporary distribution. Conclusions: Contemporary patterns of some diseases have their roots in the past. The fundamental relation between spatial patterns of social deprivation and spatial patterns of mortality is so robust that a century of change in inner London has failed to disrupt it.},

  abstract = {Global Monitoring for Environment and Security (GMES) is a joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), designed to establish a European capacity for the provision and use of operational monitoring information for environment and security applications. ESA's role in GMES is to provide the definition and the development of the space- and ground-related system elements. GMES Sentinel-2 mission provides continuity to services relying on multi-spectral high-resolution optical observations over global terrestrial surfaces. The key mission objectives for Sentinel-2 are: (1) To provide systematic global acquisitions of high-resolution multi-spectral imagery with a high revisit frequency, (2) to provide enhanced continuity of multi-spectral imagery provided by the SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) series of satellites, and (3) to provide observations for the next generation of operational products such as land-cover maps, land change detection maps, and geophysical variables. Consequently, Sentinel-2 will directly contribute to the Land Monitoring, Emergency Response, and Security services. The corresponding user requirements have driven the design toward a dependable multi-spectral Earth-observation system featuring the Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) with 13 spectral bands spanning from the visible and the near infrared to the short wave infrared. The spatial resolution varies from 10. m to 60. m depending on the spectral band with a 290. km field of view. This unique combination of high spatial resolution, wide field of view and spectral coverage will represent a major step forward compared to current multi-spectral missions. The mission foresees a series of satellites, each having a 7.25-year lifetime over a 15-year period starting with the launch of Sentinel-2A foreseen in 2013. During full operations two identical satellites will be maintained in the same orbit with a phase delay of 180?? providing a revisit time of five days at the equator. This paper provides an overview of the GMES Sentinel-2 mission including a technical system concept overview, image quality, Level 1 data processing and operational applications. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The radiometric normalization of multitemporal satellite optical images of the same terrain is often necessary for land cover change detection, e.g., relative differences. In previous studies, ground reference data or pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) were used in the radiometric rectification of multitemporal images. Ground reference data are costly and difficult to acquire for most satellite remotely sensed images and the selection of PIFs is generally subjective. In addition, previous research has been focused on radiometric normalization of two images acquired on different dates. The problem of conservation of radiometric resolution in the case of radiometric normalization between more than two images has not been addressed. This article reports on a new procedure for radiometric normalization between multitemporal images of the same area. The selection of PIFs is done statistically. With quality control, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to find linear relationships between multitemporal images of the same area. The satellite images are normalized radiometrically to a common scale tied to the reference radiometric levels. The procedure ensures the conservation of radiometric resolution for the multitemporal images involved. The new procedure is applied to three Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from three different years (August 1986, 1987, and 1991) and of the same area. Quality control measures show that the error in radiometric consistency between the multitemporal images is reduced effectively. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated using the radiometrically normalized multitemporal imagery and assessed in the context of land cover change analysis.}

Locations which experienced temporal trends of increasing or decreasing inter-annual variation in annual ISM precipitation and onset date of ISM were detected using the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. A new method of defining local onset of ISM from daily precipitation data was developed to enable countrywide temporal trend analysis of onset date. India was characterised by a heterogeneous spatial distribution in the magnitude of inter-annual variation and location of signif- icant temporal trends in the examined facets of ISM precipitation. A greater extent of the country experienced significant trends (p¡0.05) of increasing inter-annual variation rather than simple increasing or decreasing trends in annual ISM precipitation and onset date of ISM. Field significance tests showed grid cells reporting significant trends were significant (p¡0.05) at the global or field level (except trends of increas- ing, i.e. later, ISM onset date). This research provides finer spatial detail regarding trends and variation in annual ISM precipitation, severe drought years and onset date of ISM complementing recent studies on trends in extreme precipitation events over India to produce a comprehensive overview of recent behaviour of ISM precipitation. These findings will benefit water managers charged with managing water resources sustainably at a fine spatial scale (the watershed or basin level).},

Overall classification accuracies between pixel-based and object-based classifications were not statistically significant (p ¿ 0.05) when the same machine learning algorithms were applied. Using object-based image analysis, there was a statistically significant difference in classification accuracy between maps produced using the DT algorithm compared to maps produced using either RF (p =0.0116) or SVM algorithms (p =0.0067). Using pixel-based image analysis, there was no statistically significant difference (p ¿ 0.05) between results produced using different classification algorithms. Classifications based on RF and SVM algorithms provided a more visually adequate depiction of wetland, riparian, and crop land cover types when compared to DT based classifications, using either object-based or pixel-based image analysis. In this study, pixel-based classifications utilized fewer variables (15 vs. 300), achieved similar classification accuracies, and required less time to produce than object-based classifications. Object-based classifications produced a visually appealing generalized appearance of land cover classes. Based exclusively on overall accuracy reports, there was no advantage to preferring one image analysis approach over another for the purposes of mapping broad land cover types in agricultural environments using medium spatial resolution earth observation imagery. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Brazil's wind power potential is impressive. The incentive policies that have being implemented in the country, since the last decade, promoted the implementation of some projects, mainly through the Alternative Energy Sources Incentive Program (PROINFA), which started in 2002. After the first phase of PROINFA, the wind power sector in Brazil is still waiting for a new long-term program. By applying a GIS model to the available wind database, this paper evaluates three long-term incentive programs to wind power in Brazil, according to specific targets and criterion. The first target was to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases from the electricity generation, through the replacement of fossil fuels fired-thermal plants. In this case, an incentive program based on quotes and permits would install a wind capacity hovering between 18.7 and 28.9 GW. For the target of optimizing the operation of Brazil's hydropower reservoirs, a program based on feed-in tariffs would result in the installed capacity of 15.5–65.4 GW, depending on the criterion for selecting the projects. Finally, considering only the target of fostering a domestic wind technology industry, the installed capacity would vary between 29.1 and 217.1, depending on the criterion for selecting the projects.},

Statistical inference is then used to quantify the building stock per class of building size. Legaspi in the Philippines is used as a case study. The results show that texture-based computer algorithms provide accurate area estimations of the built-up, that the detail of HR imagery allows the mapping of single buildings using photo-interpretation, and that a systematic sampling approach that uses building encoding and built-up maps can be used to quantify the building stock.}

  abstract = {Australia is a major food exporting country. Recent droughts reduced dryland farming production and the volume of water allocated to irrigated agriculture, with a resulting decline in aggregate agricultural production and exports. This paper analyses the possible impact of increased water scarcity on Australian agricultural production and the magnitude of subsequent impacts on global food security. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) data on land and water use coupled with a hydro-economic stochastic modelling approach, the impacts of reduced agricultural production in the southern Murray–Darling Basin, and more generally for Australia, are analysed. Changes in agricultural activity, reduction in agricultural exports and altered composition of products exported attributed to the severe 2000–2009 drought are also analysed to highlight the implications for global food security. The impact of climate change on food production is examined. The analysis shows that climate change, when modelled as the extreme case, along with other factors such as land use, will impact Australian food exports. Despite its relatively small contribution to total global food supply, Australia's contribution to international trade in wheat, meat and dairy products is substantial and could affect global food prices. Furthermore, Australia's agricultural exports are of disproportionate importance within the South- and South–East Asian and Oceania region, both in terms of volume and for strategic reasons. Adaptation along with investment in agriculture production is needed to maintain Australian agricultural production and enhance global food security.},

The paper discusses the general vulnerability of the semi-arid zone in terms of four different types of water scarcity, the effects of which are being superimposed on each other: two are natural (type A, arid climate, type B, intermittent drought years) and two are man-induced (type C, desiccation of the landscape driven by land degradation, and type D, population-driven water stress). When fuelled by a rapid population increase, a risk spiral develops, manifesting itself in social and economic collapse during intermittent drought years. The paper concludes that many countries in Africa are heading for severe water scarcity -in fact two-thirds of the African population will live in severely water-stressed countries within a few decades. This severe water stress will largely be the result of unfettered population growth.},

  abstract = {Urban green infrastructure can to a certain extent mitigate urban warming. However, the cooling effect of plants varies with space, time and plant-specific properties. To contribute to our understanding of the cooling effect of vegetation on urban surface and air temperature, 21 parks in Addis Ababa were studied. Air temperature and humidity were measured for 60 plots in nine of the parks for 15 days. Furthermore, the thermal band of Landsat ETM+ was used to examine the cooling impact of all 21 parks on a larger spatial scale. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the relationship between characteristics of the vegetation and observed temperature. It emerged that Eucalyptus sp. had a significantly higher cooling effect than any other species group (P¡. 0.05) and the species with the least effect on temperature were Grevillea and Cupressus. On a larger spatial scale, the cooling effect of parks on their surroundings (Park Cooling Intensity, PCI) was positively related to the NDVI and area of parks (P¡. 0.01). A negative relationship was observed between PCI and park shape index (SI). The range within which the cooling effect could be observed (Park Cooling Distance, PCD) was positively related to SI and park area. The maximum PCI was 6.72. ??C and the maximum PCD was estimated at 240. m. We conclude that the cooling effect is mainly determined by species group, canopy cover, size and shape of parks. Thus, the study provides insights regarding the importance of species choice and spatial design of green spaces in cooling the environment. ?? 2013.},

  abstract = {The new Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) is intended to be broadly compatible with the previous Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+). The spectral response of the OLI is slightly different to the ETM+, and so there may be slight differences in the reflectance measurements. Since the differences are a function not just of spectral responses, but also of the target pixels, there is a need to assess these differences in practice, using imagery from the area of interest. This paper presents a large scale study of the differences between ETM+ and OLI in the Australian landscape. The analysis is carried out in terms of both top-of-atmosphere and surface reflectance, and also in terms of biophysical parameters modelled from those respective reflectance spectra. The results show small differences between the sensors, which can be magnified by modelling to a biophysical parameter. It is also shown that a part of this difference appears to be systematic, and can be reliably removed by regression equations to predict ETM+ reflectance from OLI reflectance, before applying biophysical models. This is important when models have been fitted to historical field data coincident with ETM+ imagery. However, there will remain a small per-pixel difference which could be an unwanted source of variability.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer consumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet's resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and ameliorate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between immediate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

Therefore, since it is timely to get an overview of the subject, the aim of this article is to review the use of VGI as reference data for land cover map validation. The main platforms and types of VGI that are used and that are potentially useful are analysed. Since quality is a fundamental issue in map validation, the quality procedures used by the platforms that collect VGI to increase and control data quality are reviewed and a framework for addressing VGI quality assessment is proposed. A review of cases where VGI was used as an additional data source to assist in map validation is made, as well as cases where only VGI was used, indicating the procedures used to assess VGI quality and fitness for use. A discussion and some conclusions are drawn on best practices, future potential and the challenges of the use of VGI for land cover map validation.},

A constraint on their application in remote sensing has been their binary nature, requiring multiclass classifications to be based upon a large number of binary analyses. Here, an approach for multiclass classification of airborne sensor data by a single SVM analysis is evaluated against a series of classifiers that are widely used in remote sensing, with particular regard to the effect of training set size on classification accuracy. In addition to the SVM, the same datasets were classified using a discriminant analysis, decision tree, and multilayer perceptron neural network. The accuracy statements of the classifications derived from the different classifiers were compared in a statistically rigorous fashion that accommodated for the related nature of the samples used in the analyses. For each classification technique, accuracy was positively related with the size of the training set. In general, the most accurate classifications were derived from the SVM approach, and with the largest training set the SVM classification was significantly (p ¡ 0.05)more accurate (93.75\%) than that derived from the discriminant analysis (90.00\%) and decision tree algorithms (90.31\%). Although each classifier could yield a very accurate classification, ¿ 90\% correct, the classifiers differed in the ability to correctly label individual cases and so may be suitable candidates for an ensemble-based approach to classification.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of a supervised image classification is a function of the training data used in its generation. It is, therefore, critical that the training stage of a supervised classification is designed to provide the necessary information. Guidance on the design of the training stage of a classification typically calls for the use of a large sample of randomly selected pure pixels in order to characterise the classes. Such guidance is generally made without regard to the specific nature of the application in-hand, including the classifier to be used. The design of the training stage should really be based on the classifier to be used since individual training cases can vary in value as can any one training set to a range of classifiers. It is argued here that the training stage can be designed on the basis of the way the classifier operates and with emphasis on the desire to separate the classes rather than describe them. An approach to the training of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that is the opposite of that generally promoted for training set design is suggested. This approach uses a small sample of mixed spectral responses drawn from purposefully selected locations (geographical boundaries) in training. The approach is based on mixed pixels which are normally masked-out of analyses as undesirable and problematic. A sample of such data should, however, be easier and cheaper to acquire than that suggested by conventional approaches. This new approach to training set design was evaluated against conventional approaches with a set of classifications of agricultural crops from satellite sensor data. The main result was that classifications derived from the use of the mixed spectral responses and the conventional approach did not differ significantly, with the overall accuracy of classifications generally ??? 92\%. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Remote sensing has considerable potential for providing accurate, up-to-date information in urban areas. Urban remote sensing is complicated, however, by very high spectral and spatial complexity. In this paper, Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) was applied to map urban land cover using HyMap data acquired over the city of Bonn, Germany. MESMA is well suited for urban environments because it allows the number and types of endmembers to vary on a per-pixel basis, which allows controlling the large spectral variability in these environments. We employed a hierarchical approach, in which MESMA was applied to map four levels of complexity ranging from the simplest level consisting of only two classes, impervious and pervious, to 20 classes that differentiated material composition and plant species. Lower levels of complexity, mapped at the highest accuracies, were used to constrain spatially models at higher levels of complexity, reducing spectral confusion between materials. A spectral library containing 1521 endmembers was created from the HyMap data. Three endmember selection procedures, Endmember Average RMS (EAR), Minimum Average Spectral Angle (MASA) and Count Based Endmember Selection (COB), were used to identify the most representative endmembers for each level of complexity. Combined two-, three- or four-endmember models - depending on the hierarchical level - were applied, and the highest endmember fractions were used to assign a land cover class. Classification accuracies of 97.2\% were achieved for the two lowest complexity levels, consisting of impervious and pervious classes, and a four class map consisting of vegetation, bare soil, water and built-up. At the next level of complexity, consisting of seven classes including trees, grass, bare soil, river, lakes/basins, road and roof/building, classification accuracies remained high at 81.7\% with most classes mapped above 85\% accuracy. At the highest level, consisting of 20 land cover classes, a 75.9\% classification accuracy was achieved. The ability of MESMA to incorporate within-class spectral variability, combined with a hierarchical approach that uses spatial information from one level to constrain model selection at a higher level of complexity was shown to be particularly well suited for urban environments. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEMeducation published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.

  abstract = {Until recently, advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) observations were the only viable source of data for global land cover mapping. While many useful insights have been gained from analyses based on AVHRR data, the availability of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data with greatly improved spectral, spatial, geometric, and radiometric attributes provides significant new opportunities and challenges for remote sensing-based land cover mapping research. In this paper, we describe the algorithms and databases being used to produce the MODIS global land cover product. This product provides maps of global land cover at 1-km spatial resolution using several classification systems, principally that of the IGBP. To generate these maps, a supervised classification methodology is used that exploits a global database of training sites interpreted from high-resolution imagery in association with ancillary data. In addition to the IGBP class at each pixel, the MODIS land cover product provides several other parameters including estimates for the classification confidence associated with the IGBP label, a prediction for the most likely alternative class, and class labels for several other classification schemes that are used by the global modeling community. Initial results based on 5 months of MODIS data are encouraging. At global scales, the distribution of vegetation and land cover types is qualitatively realistic. At regional scales, comparisons among heritage AVHRR products, Landsat TM data, and results from MODIS show that the algorithm is performing well. As a longer time series of data is added to the processing stream and the representation of global land cover in the site database is refined, the quality of the MODIS land cover product will improve accordingly.},

In the past decade, data sources and methodologies for creating global land cover maps from remote sensing have evolved rapidly. Here we describe the datasets and algorithms used to create the Collection 5 MODIS Global Land Cover Type product, which is substantially changed relative to Collection 4. In addition to using updated input data, the algorithm and ancillary datasets used to produce the product have been refined. Most importantly, the Collection 5 product is generated at 500-m spatial resolution, providing a four-fold increase in spatial resolution relative to the previous version. In addition, many components of the classification algorithm have been changed. The training site database has been revised, land surface temperature is now included as an input feature, and ancillary datasets used in post-processing of ensemble decision tree results have been updated. Further, methods used to correct classifier results for bias imposed by training data properties have been refined, techniques used to fuse ancillary data based on spatially varying prior probabilities have been revised, and a variety of methods have been developed to address limitations of the algorithm for the urban, wetland, and deciduous needleleaf classes. Finally, techniques used to stabilize classification results across years have been developed and implemented to reduce year-to-year variation in land cover labels not associated with land cover change. Results from a cross-validation analysis indicate that the overall accuracy of the product is about 75\% correctly classified, but that the range in class-specific accuracies is large. Comparison of Collection 5 maps with Collection 4 results show substantial differences arising from increased spatial resolution and changes in the input data and classification algorithm. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.},

Shanghai Declaration on Better Cities, Better Life 1. ISSUES AND CHALLENGES 1 Urban leaders understand that effective management is crucial to the successful implementation of an urban development plan. As mayor, one of your first steps might be to assess if the management systems currently in place are adequate for implementing, monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the plan and the provision of related public services. Management challenges in metro areas abound. Cities struggle every day to meet daily operational needs while at the same time investing in the future – all with limited financial resources. Perhaps the main challenge currently facing local governments of large cities in developing nations is how to provide essential services–including housing, energy, water, sanitation, health and education–to meet the basic needs of an ever-growing population. In many developing countries such growing populations include a significant amount of people who are born in or migrate into poorly managed slum settlements. Inadequate public services related to health, education, housing and a lack of security of tenure are at the core of urban poverty and vulnerability. 2 The management of urban growth also requires adequate supply of land and appropriate plans for its use and deployment of infrastructure.},

Emergency organizations will be able to assess response readiness of a community for chemical releases and prioritize antidote stockpiling, training, and security. Emergency organizations and first responders will use the FALCON DSS to simulate and prepare for real-time events, assess possible casualties, and receive emergency contact information.

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is a valuable parameter in studies of surface energy balance, landscape thermal patterns, and human-environment interactions. An effective way to quantify the LST dynamics over spatial and temporal domains is to utilize the consistent Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) data since 1982. Currently, only a small proportion of studies utilized the Landsat TIR data for investigating both the intra-and interannual LST variations. The objectives of the study are to provide statistical evidence for the existence of the annual temperature cycle (ATC) and to develop a decomposition technique to explore landscape thermal patterns by land cover. Eighty-two cloud-free TIR images of Los Angeles County from Landsat TM between 2000 and 2010 were collected and consistently calibrated to the LSTs. The LSTs were then analyzed by the Lomb-Scargle periodogram technique to test whether the time series LSTs showed rhythmic patterns and by a decomposition model to analyze the intra- and interannual landscape thermal patterns. The periodogram analysis confirmed that ATC was statistically significant with the periodic time of 362 days. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis showed that the Lomb-Scargle technique can still discover the ATC with the difference of up to five days, even when the number of images decreased to 60. Based on the periodogram analysis, a decomposition model was initialized to disassemble the time series LSTs into seasonality and trend components for comparisons among land covers. Results suggested that the developed areas exhibited relatively low seasonal amplitude of 11.7 K, while largest mean annual LST value is 302.8 K. The difference of the averaged trend component between urban and other land covers reached 1.1 K over the decade. Future research may be directed in dealing with the time-varying seasonality component for better quantifying the thermal patterns.},

  abstract = {Sequences of satellite images are increasingly being used to monitor our environment. An important step in the development of methods for detecting, measuring, and monitoring change through time is the ability to compare images from different dates and sites in different scenes. These comparisons require the digital counts from each scene to be calibrated to common reference values. A method of relative calibration using robust regression and large numbers of likely invariant targets has been developed and implemented operationally. One or more images are calibrated to the digital numbers of a common reference scene. The technique has been used to calibrate over 100 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) scenes of the Western Australian wheatbelt. The method and its application are described. The repeatability of the calibrations over a sequence of images of the same scene from different dates is examined.},

This paper discusses the lecture in the framework of theories of learning in general and the medical problem-based learning tradition in particular. An example of how theories of learning can be implemented in the lecture hall is presented. Theories that underpin PBL as an educational philosophy rather than as a method of instruction are reviewed. A lecture form, organized in introductory, in depth and application lectures, that responds to important factors for stimulating deep processing of knowledge and meaningful learning is discussed. Examples of and practical points about how to renew and restructure lectures in a way that counteracts surface approaches to learning, teacher centering and student passivity are presented. We argue that, with proper awareness of possible drawbacks of the large format, lectures can be used as valuable tools for learning also in a PBL curriculum.},

  abstract = {We analyse historical (1900 – present) and recent (year 2002) data on New York city's urban heat island (UHI) effect, to characterize changes over time and spatially within the city. The historical annual data show that UHI intensification is responsible for ∼1/3 of the total warming the city has experienced since 1900. The intensification correlates with a significant drop in windspeed over the century, likely due to an increase in the urban boundary layer as Manhattan's extensive skyline development unfolded. For the current-day, using 2002 data, we calculate the hourly and seasonal strength of the city's UHI for five different case study areas, including sites in Manhattan, Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn. We find substantial intra-city variation (∼2 °C) in the strength of the hourly UHI, with some locations showing daytime cool islands – i.e., temperatures lower than the average of the distant non-urban stations, while others, at the same time, show daytime heat islands. The variations are not easily explained in terms of land surface characteristics such as building stock, population, vegetation fraction or radiometric surface temperatures from remote sensing. Although it has been suggested that stations within urban parks will underestimate UHI, the Central Park station does not show a significant underestimate, except marginally during summer nights. The intra-city heat island variations in the residential areas broadly correlate with summertime electricity demand and sensitivity to temperature increases. This relationship will have practical value for energy demand management policy, as it will help prioritize areas for UHI mitigation.},

Vertical accuracy of digital terrain models (DTMs) derived from GPS, TLS and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is assessed. Point elevations acquired by the four methods represent two sections of a mountainous area in Cumbria, England. They were chosen so that the presence of non-terrain features is constrained to the smallest amount. The vertical accuracy of the DTMs was addressed by subtracting each DTM from TPS point elevations. The error was assessed using exploratory measures including statistics, histograms, and normal probability plots. The results showed that the internal measurement accuracy of TPS, GPS, and TLS was below a centimetre. TPS and GPS can be considered equally applicable alternatives for sampling the terrain in areas accessible on foot. The highest DTM vertical accuracy was achieved with GPS data, both on sloped terrain (RMSE 0.16 m) and flat terrain (RMSE 0.02 m). TLS surveying was the most efficient overall but veracity of terrain representation was subject to dense vegetation cover. Therefore, the DTM accuracy was the lowest for the sloped area with dense bracken (RMSE 0.52 m) although it was the second highest on the flat unobscured terrain (RMSE 0.07 m). ALS data represented the sloped terrain more realistically (RMSE 0.23 m) than the TLS. However, due to a systematic bias identified on the flat terrain the DTM accuracy was the lowest (RMSE 0.29 m) which was above the level stated by the data provider. Error distribution models were more closely approximated by normal distribution defined using median and normalized median absolute deviation which supports the use of the robust measures in DEM error modelling and its propagation.},

Worth Texas region. The primary advantage of using these combined datasets included the capability to designate each 1. ??. 1. km grid cell of available temperature data as urban or rural based on the level of impervious surface area within the grid cell. Generally, the observed differences in urban and rural temperature increased as the impervious surface area thresholds used to define an urban grid cell were increased. This result, however, was also dependent on the size of the sample area included in the analysis. As the spatial extent of the sample area increased and included a greater number of rural defined grid cells, the observed urban and rural differences in temperature also increased. A cursory comparison of the spatially gridded temperature observations with observations from climate stations suggest that the number and location of stations included in an urban heat island analysis requires consideration to assure representative samples of each (urban and rural) environment are included in the analysis. ?? 2014.},

Results for six dimensions are reported for each area, and an initial comparison of the extent of sprawl in the 13 areas is provided.

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been widely used for remote sensing of vegetation for many years. This index uses radiances or reflectances from a red channel around 0.66 ??m and a near-IR channel around 0.86 ??m. The red channel is located in the strong chlorophyll absorption region, while the near-IR channel is located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. The two channels sense very different depths through vegetation canopies. In this article, another index, namely the normalized difference water index (NDWI), is proposed for remote sensing of vegetation liquid water from space. NDWI is defined as (p(0.86 ??m) - ??(1.24 ??m))/(??(0.86 ??m) + ??(1.24 ??m)), where ?? represents the radiance in reflectance units. Both the 0.86-??m and the 1.24-??m channels are located in the high reflectance plateau of vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. They sense similar depths through vegetation canopies. Absorption by vegetation liquid water near 0.86 ??m is negligible. Weak liquid absorption at 1.24 ??m is present. Canopy scattering enhances the water absorption. As a result, NDWI is sensitive to changes in liquid water content of vegetation canopies. Atmospheric aerosol scattering effects in the 0.86-1.24 ??m region are weak. NDWI is less sensitive to atmospheric effects than NDVI. NDWI does not remove completely the background soil reflectance effects, similar to NDVI. Because the information about vegetation canopies contained in the 1.24-??m channel is very different from that contained in the red channel near 0.66 ??m. NDWI should be considered as an independent vegetation index. It is complementary to, not a substitute for NDVI. Laboratory-measured reflectance of stacked green leaves, and spectral imaging data acquired with Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) over Jasper Ridge in California and the High Plains in northern Colorado, are used to demonstrate the usefulness of NDWI. Comparisons between NDWI and NDVI images are also given.},

  abstract = {A procedure to achieve the semi-automatic relative image normalization of multitemporal remote images of an agricultural scene called ARIN was developed using the following procedures: 1) defining the same parcel of selected vegetative pseudo-invariant features (VPIFs) in each multitemporal image; 2) extracting data concerning the VPIF spectral bands from each image; 3) calculating the correction factors (CFs) for each image band to fit each image band to the average value of the image series; and 4) obtaining the normalized images by linear transformation of each original image band through the corresponding CF. ARIN software was developed to semi-automatically perform the ARIN procedure. We have validated ARIN using seven GeoEye-1 satellite images taken over the same location in Southern Spain from early April to October 2010 at an interval of approximately 3 to 4 weeks. The following three VPIFs were chosen: citrus orchards (CIT), olive orchards (OLI) and poplar groves (POP). In the ARIN-normalized images, the range, standard deviation (s. d.) and root mean square error (RMSE) of the spectral bands and vegetation indices were considerably reduced compared to the original images, regardless of the VPIF or the combination of VPIFs selected for normalization, which demonstrates the method's efficacy. The correlation coefficients between the CFs among VPIFs for any spectral band (and all bands overall) were calculated to be at least 0.85 and were significant at P = 0.95, indicating that the normalization procedure was comparably performed regardless of the VPIF chosen. ARIN method was designed only for agricultural and forestry landscapes where VPIFs can be identified.}

  abstract = {Anthropogenic semivolatile organic compounds (SOCs) that persist in the environment, bioaccumulate, are toxic at low concentrations, and undergo long-range atmospheric transport (LRT) were identified and quantified in the atmosphere of a Saharan dust source region (Mali) and during Saharan dust incursions at downwind sites in the eastern Caribbean (U.S. Virgin Islands, Trinidad and Tobago) and Cape Verde. More organochlorine and organophosphate pesticides (OCPPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners were detected in the Saharan dust region than at downwind sites. Seven of the 13 OCPPs detected occurred at all sites: chlordanes, chlorpyrifos, dacthal, dieldrin, endosulfans, hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and trifluralin. Total SOCs ranged from 1.9–126 ng/m3 (mean = 25 ± 34) at source and 0.05–0.71 ng/m3 (mean = 0.24 ± 0.18) at downwind sites during dust conditions. Most SOC concentrations were 1–3 orders of magnitude higher in source than downwind sites. A Saharan source was confirmed for sampled air masses at downwind sites based on dust particle elemental composition and rare earth ratios, atmospheric back trajectory models, and field observations. SOC concentrations were considerably below existing occupational and/or regulatory limits; however, few regulatory limits exist for these persistent organic compounds. Long-term effects of chronic exposure to low concentrations of SOCs are unknown, as are possible additive or synergistic effects of mixtures of SOCs, biologically active trace metals, and mineral dust particles transported together in Saharan dust air masses.},

It was originally developed to work in the short wavelengths (0.3–3 µm) within 3D natural scenes that are represented as matrices of rectangular cells containing trees, shrubs, grass, soil, etc. DART was recently modified to extend its domain of application and to improve its accuracy. This paper summarizes the major features of DART and presents the changes that were implemented for improving its accuracy. Presently, this model works with natural and urban landscapes, on the whole optical domain (thermal infrared included) and with a multispectral approach that uses optical data bases from 0.3 µm up to 15 µm. It simulates radiative transfer in the whole ‘atmosphere–Earth' system and it accounts for the instrumental transfer function. Three major changes allowed us to improve DART accuracy by a factor of three: more accurate simulation of single and multiple scattering, use of a scheme that oversamples DART cells and a better account of the direction of radiation that gives rise to multiple scattered radiation.},

  abstract = {Map makers have for many years searched for a way to construct cartograms, maps in which the sizes of geographic regions such as countries or provinces appear in proportion to their population or some other analogous property. Such maps are invaluable for the representation of census results, election returns, disease incidence, and many other kinds of human data. Unfortunately, to scale regions and still have them fit together, one is normally forced to distort the regions' shapes, potentially resulting in maps that are difficult to read. Many methods for making cartograms have been proposed, some of them are extremely complex, but all suffer either from this lack of readability or from other pathologies, like overlapping regions or strong dependence on the choice of coordinate axes. Here, we present a technique based on ideas borrowed from elementary physics that suffers none of these drawbacks. Our method is conceptually simple and produces useful, elegant, and easily readable maps. We illustrate the method with applications to the results of the 2000 U.S. presidential election, lung cancer cases in the State of New York, and the geographical distribution of stories appearing in the news.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data and methods are widely deployed in order to contribute to the assessment of numerous components of earthquake risk. While for earthquake hazard-related investigations, the use of remotely sensed data is an established methodological element with a long research tradition, earthquake vulnerability–centred assessments incorporating remote sensing data are increasing primarily in recent years. This goes along with a changing perspective of the scientific community which considers the assessment of vulnerability and its constituent elements as a pivotal part of a comprehensive risk analysis. Thereby, the availability of new sensors systems enables an appreciable share of remote sensing first. In this manner, a survey of the interdisciplinary conceptual literature dealing with the scientific perception of risk, hazard and vulnerability reveals the demand for a comprehensive description of earthquake hazards as well as an assessment of the present and future conditions of the elements exposed. A review of earthquake-related remote sensing literature, realized both in a qualitative and quantitative manner, shows the already existing and published manifold capabilities of remote sensing contributing to assess earthquake risk. These include earthquake hazard-related analysis such as detection and measurement of lineaments and surface deformations in pre- and post-event applications. Furthermore, pre-event seismic vulnerability–centred assessment of the built and natural environment and damage assessments for post-event applications are presented. Based on the review and the discussion of scientific trends and current research projects, first steps towards a roadmap for remote sensing are drawn, explicitly taking scientific, technical, multi- and transdisciplinary as well as political perspectives into account, which is intended to open possible future research activities.},

  abstract = {The assessment of groundwater vulnerability to pollution aims at highlighting areas at a high risk of being polluted. This study presents a methodology, to estimate the risk of an aquifer to be polluted from concentrated and/or dispersed sources, which applies an overlay and index method involving several parameters. The parameters are categorized into three factor groups: factor group 1 includes parameters relevant to the internal aquifer system's properties, thus determining the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability to pollution; factor group 2 comprises parameters relevant to the external stresses to the system, such as human activities and rainfall effects; factor group 3 incorporates specific geological settings, such as the presence of geothermal fields or salt intrusion zones, into the computation process. Geographical information systems have been used for data acquisition and processing, coupled with a multicriteria evaluation technique enhanced with fuzzy factor standardization. Moreover, besides assigning weights to factors, a second set of weights, i.e., order weights, has been applied to factors on a pixel by pixel basis, thus allowing control of the level of risk in the vulnerability determination and the enhancement of local site characteristics. Individual analysis of each factor group resulted in three intermediate groundwater vulnerability to pollution maps, which were combined in order to produce the final composite groundwater vulnerability map for the study area. The method has been applied in the region of Eastern Macedonia and Thrace (Northern Greece), an area of approximately 14,000 km¡sup¿2¡/sup¿. The methodology has been tested and calibrated against the measured nitrate concentration in wells, in the northwest part of the study area, providing results related to the aggregation and weighting procedure.},

This paper presents a study to assess and compare the impacts of the proposed ski areas within two valleys strongly linked to winter tourism: the Fiemme and Fassa Valleys. The method is based on the computation of spatial indicators using a Geographical Information System (GIS) to predict and quantify critical impacts, such as ecosystem loss and fragmentation, soil erosion, geomorphologic hazards, interference with flora and fauna, and visibility. Subsequently, multicriteria analysis was applied to generate composite indices, and to rank ski areas according to their overall suitability. Finally, sensitivity analyses allowed to test the stability of the results. The study concluded that two of the proposed ski areas are located in highly unsuitable environment, and the relevant plan provisions should be revised.},

The overall Kappa accuracy of the random forest classifier that used a combination of spectral and local spatial (Getis) variables at three different neighbourhood sizes (3x3, 7x7, and 11x11) ranged from 0.85 to 0.92. This accuracy was higher than that of a non-spatial random forest classifier having an overall Kappa accuracy of 0.78, which was run using the spectral variables only. This study demonstrated that the use of the Getis statistic with different neighbourhood sizes leads to substantial increase in per class classification accuracy of heterogeneous land-cover categories.},

The most useful satellite imagery for the assessment of earthquake damage comes from high-resolution (0.6 m to 1 m pixel size) passive sensors and moderate resolution active sensors that can quantify the vertical and horizontal movement of the earth's surface. High-resolution passive sensors have been used successfully to assess flood damage while predictive maps of flood vulnerability areas are possible based on physical variables collected from passive and active sensors. Recent moderate resolution sensors are able to provide near real-time data on fires and provide quantitative data used in fire behavior models. Limitations currently exist due to atmospheric interference, pixel resolution, and revisit times. However, a number of new microsatellites and constellations of satellites will be launched in the next five years that contain increased resolution (0.5 m to 1 m pixel resolution for active sensors) and revisit times (daily ¡2.3 m resolution images from passive sensors) that will significantly improve our ability to assess and predict natural hazards from space.},

It consists of a significant increase in temperatures, especially in industrialized and urbanized areas, in particular, during extreme warm periods like summer. This paper explores the climate variability of temperatures in two stations located in Matera city (Southern Italy), evaluating the increase in temperatures from 1988 to 2015. Moreover, the Corine Land Covers (1990-2000-2006-2012) were used in order to investigate the effect of land use on temperatures. The results obtained confirm the prevalence of UHI phenomena for industrialized areas, highlighting the proposal that the spreading of settlements may further drive these effects on the microclimate. In particular, the presence of industrial structures, even in rural areas, shows a clear increase in summer maximum temperatures. This does not occur in the period before 2000, probably due to the absence of the industrial settlement. On the contrary, from 2000 to 2015, changes are not relevant, but the maximum temperatures have always been higher than in the suburban area (station localized in green zone) during daylight hours.},

In recent years, substantial advancement has been achieved in generating such data products. Yet, we are far from producing geospatially consistent high-quality data at an operational level. We compared the recently available Global Land Cover 2000 (GLC-2000) and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) global land cover data to evaluate the similarities and differences in methodologies and results, and to identify areas of spatial agreement and disagreement. These two global land cover data sets were prepared using different data sources, classification systems, and methodologies, but using the same spatial resolution (i.e., 1 km) satellite data. Our analysis shows a general agreement at the class aggregate level except for savannas/shrublands, and wetlands. The disagreement, however, increases when comparing detailed land cover classes. Similarly, percent agreement between the two data sets was found to be highly variable among biomes. The identified areas of spatial agreement and disagreement will be useful for both data producers and users. Data producers may use the areas of spatial agreement for training area selection and pay special attention to areas of disagreement for further improvement in future land cover characterization and mapping. Users can conveniently use the findings in the areas of agreement, whereas users might need to verify the informaiton in the areas of disagreement with the help of secondary information. Learning from past experience and building on the existing infrastructure (e.g., regional networks), further research is necessary to (1) reduce ambiguity in land cover definitions, (2) increase availability of improved spatial, spectral, radiometric, and geometric resolution satellite data, and (3) develop advanced classification algorithms.},

Our approach combines two ideas: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data are scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, boosts performance significantly. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call the resulting model an R-CNN or Region-based Convolutional Network.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prior studies from around the world have indicated that very high temperatures tend to increase summertime mortality. However possible effect modification by urban micro heat islands has only been examined by a few studies in North America and Europe. This study examined whether daily mortality in micro heat island areas of Hong Kong was more sensitive to short term changes in meteorological conditions than in other areas. METHOD: An urban heat island index (UHII) was calculated for each of Hong Kong's 248 geographical tertiary planning units (TPU). Daily counts of all natural deaths among Hong Kong residents were stratified according to whether the place of residence of the decedent was in a TPU with high (above the median) or low UHII. Poisson Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to estimate the association between meteorological variables and mortality while adjusting for trend, seasonality, pollutants and flu epidemics. Analyses were restricted to the hot season (June-September). RESULTS: Mean temperatures (lags 0-4) above 29 °C and low mean wind speeds (lags 0-4) were significantly associated with higher daily mortality and these associations were stronger in areas with high UHII. A 1 °C rise above 29 °C was associated with a 4.1\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.7\%, 7.6\%) increase in natural mortality in areas with high UHII but only a 0.7\% (95\% CI: -2.4\%, 3.9\%) increase in low UHII areas. Lower mean wind speeds (5(th) percentile vs. 95(th) percentile) were associated with a 5.7\% (95\% CI: 2.7, 8.9) mortality increase in high UHII areas vs. a -0.3\% (95\% CI: -3.2\%, 2.6\%) change in low UHII areas. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that urban micro heat islands exacerbate the negative health consequences of high temperatures and low wind speeds. Urban planning measures designed to mitigate heat island effects may lessen the health effects of unfavorable summertime meteorological conditions.},

  abstract = {A deeper understanding of extreme hot weather are needed in cities sensitive to heat effects, an investigation was done in the tropical town of Kaohsiung in Taiwan. Its 11 districts were divided into three climatic classes varying from high urban heat, low levels of green space and lack of proximity to water bodies to low urban heat, adequate green space and proximity to water bodies. Daily data on natural mortality, meteorological variables, and pollutants from May-October 1999-2008 were analysed using generalised additive models for the time-series data. Subgroup analyses were conducted, stratifying decedents according to the level of planning activity required in order to mitigate adverse heat effects in their residential areas, classifying districts as "level 1" for those requiring a high level of mitigation action; "level 2" for those requiring some action; and "level 3" for those that need only preserve existing conditions. Stratified analyses showed that mortality increases per 1 °C rise on average, either on the same day or in the previous 4 days (lags 0-4), were associated with 2.8\%, 2.3\% and -1.3\% for level 1, 2 and 3 districts, respectively. The slope describing the association between temperature and mortality was higher above 29.0 °C resulting in corresponding increases of 4.2\%, 5.0\% and 0.3\% per per 1 °C rise in temperature, respectively. Other meteorological variables were not significantly associated with mortality. It is concluded that hot season mortality in Kaohsiung is only sensitive to heat effects in districts classified as having unfavourably climatic conditions and requiring mitigation efforts in city planning. Urban planning measures designed to improve climatic conditions could reduce excess mortality resulting from extreme hot weather.},

No such cases are readily apparent for the current generation of geobrowsers, though the text of the 1998 Gore speech refers to several. An analysis of the use cases of geographic information systems (GIS) reveals similarities with the functionality of geobrowsers, inviting the view that the two forms of geographic information technology will eventually converge. However, experience suggests that users are finding very different ways of exploiting geobrowsers, and two examples are discussed in detail. These uses can be interpreted within a broad framework of spatial concepts, and the paper concludes that this framework provides a better guide to the future of geobrowsers and Digital Earth than current GIS technology.}

The classification of tree crown areas was derived from the location of last-return data, filtered to remove the incidence of last returns caused by the interaction of the lidar beam with building edges, and height rules. Validation showed that building areas derived from lidar compared well with aerial photography estimates (r2 = 0.96, p ¡0.001, n = 98). The percentage difference between estimates was equal to 16\% (n = 83) when buildings were discriminated from the surrounding features. However, the percentage difference between estimates increased to 35\% (n = 98) when commission errors were considered, as lidar often overestimated building areas due to closely spaced buildings (gaps less than 1–2 m) not being separated.

Once these primary attributes were derived, we demonstrate the extraction of a number of secondary attributes including building mean height, normalized building volume, building wall surface area, and interelement spacing.

It has also suffered from dust storm during the recent two decades. So, emissions from transportation systems, steel, oil, black carbon, and other industries as anthropogenic sources and dust storm as a new phenomenon are two major concerns of air pollution in Ahvaz. Without any doubt, they can cause many serious problems for the environment and humans in this megacity. The main objective of the present study was to estimate the impact of ground-level ozone (GLO) as a secondary pollutant on human heath. Data of GLO in four monitoring stations were collected at the first step and they were processed and at the final step they were inserted to a health effect model. Findings showed that cumulative cases of cardiovascular and respiratory deaths which attributed to GLO were 43 and 173 persons, respectively. Corresponding RR for these two events were 1.008 (95 \% CI) and 1.004 (95 \% CI), respectively. Although we did not provide a distinction between winter and summer in case of mentioned mortalities attributed to GLO, ozone concentrations in winter due to more fuel consumption and sub adiabatic condition in tropospheric atmospherewere higher than those GLO in summer.},

In some parts of the world dust storms occur frequently throughout the year. They can transport particulate material, pollutants, and potential allergens over thousands of km from source. The main sources include the Sahara, central and eastern Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the western USA. In some parts of the world, though not all, the frequency of dust storms is changing in response to land use and climatic changes, and in such locations the health implications may become more severe. Data on the PM10 and P2.5 loadings of dust events are discussed, as are various pollutants (heavy metals, pesticides, etc.) and biological components (spores, fungi, bacteria, etc.). Particulate loadings can far exceed healthy levels. Among the human health effects of dust storms are respiratory disorders (including asthma, tracheitis, pneumonia, allergic rhinitis and silicosis) cardiovascular disorders (including stroke), conjunctivitis, skin irritations, meningococcal meningitis, valley fever, diseases associated with toxic algal blooms and mortality and injuries related to transport accidents.},

  abstract = {Objectives: We examined how individual and area socio-demographic characteristics independently modified the extreme heat (EH)-mortality association among elderly residents of 8 Michigan cities, May-September, 1990-2007. Methods: In a time-stratified case-crossover design, we regressed cause-specific mortality against EH (indicator for 4-day mean, minimum, maximum or apparent temperature above 97th or 99th percentiles). We examined effect modification with interactions between EH and personal marital status, age, race, sex and education and ZIP-code percent "non-green space" (National Land Cover Dataset), age, race, income, education, living alone, and housing age (U.S. Census). Results: In models including multiple effect modifiers, the odds of cardiovascular mortality during EH (99th percentile threshold) vs. non-EH were higher among non-married individuals (1.21, 95\% CI=1.14-1.28 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI=0.90-1.07 among married individuals) and individuals in ZIP codes with high (91\%) non-green space (1.17, 95\% CI=1.06-1.29 vs. 0.98, 95\% CI=0.89-1.07 among individuals in ZIP codes with low (39\%) non-green space). Results suggested that housing age may also be an effect modifier. For the EH-respiratory mortality association, the results were inconsistent between temperature metrics and percentile thresholds of EH but largely insignificant. Conclusions: Green space, housing and social isolation may independently enhance elderly peoples' heat-related cardiovascular mortality vulnerability. Local adaptation efforts should target areas and populations at greater risk.},

  abstract = {In recent years improvements in spatial data acquisition technologies, such as LiDAR, resulted in an explosive increase in the volume of spatial data, presenting unprecedented challenges for computation capacity. At the same time, the kernel of computing platforms the CPU, also evolved from a single-core to multi-core architecture. This radical change significantly affected existing data processing algorithms. Exemplified by the problem of generating DEM from massive air-borne LiDAR point clouds, this paper studies how to leverage the power of multi-core platforms for large-scale geospatial data processing and demonstrates how multi-core technologies can improve performance. Pipelining is adopted to exploit the thread level parallelism of multi-core platforms. First, raw point clouds are partitioned into overlapped blocks. Second, these discrete blocks are interpolated concurrently on parallel pipelines. On the interpolation run, intermediate results are sorted and finally merged into an integrated DEM. This parallelization demonstrates the great potential of multi-core platforms with high data throughput and low memory footprint. This approach achieves excellent performance speedup with greatly reduced processing time. For example, on a 2.0 GHz Quad-Core Intel Xeon platform, the proposed parallel approach can process approximately one billion LiDAR points (16.4 GB) in about 12 min and produces a 27,500×30,500 raster DEM, using less than 800 MB main memory.},

  abstract = {The present study focuses on determining the relationship of estimated land surface temperature (LST) with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) for Florence and Naples cities in Italy using Landsat 8 data. The study also classifies different land use/land cover LU–LC) types using NDVI and NDBI threshold values, iterative self-organizing data analysis technique and maximum likelihood classifier, and analyses the relationship built by LST with the built-up area and bare land. Urban thermal field variance index was applied to determine the thermal and ecological comfort level of the city. Several urban heat islands (UHIs) were extracted as the most heated zones within the city boundaries due to increasing anthropogenic activities. The difference between the mean LST of UHI and non-UHI is 3.15°C and 3.31°C, respectively, for Florence and Naples. LST build a strong correlation with NDVI (negative) and NDBI (positive) for both the cities as a whole, especially for the non-UHIs. But, the strength of correlation becomes much weaker within the UHIs. Moreover, most of the UHIs (85.21\% in Naples and 76.62\% in Florence) are developed within the built-up area or bare land and are demarcated as an ecologically stressed zone.},

  abstract = {One goal of the smart growth movement is a more compact urban form, intended to reduce energy use and the cost of moving materials, products, and people. The benefits ot compactness are compro-mised, however, if higher densities and more intense land use create urban heat islands, which increase water and energy use. This study examines the effects of Phoenix's urban heat island on water use by single-family residences, controlling for relevant population and housing attributes. Our statistical analysis demonstrates that increasing daily low temperatures by 1° Fahrenheit is asso-ciated with an average monthly increase in water use of 290 gallons for a typical single-family unit. These results suggest that planners should consider efFects on water demand as well as other environ-mental consequences when they evaluate growth strarⁱes, and use incentives to encourage efficiency and sustainability.

  abstract = {Objectives Poverty, often defined as a lack of resources to achieve a living standard that is deemed acceptable by society, may be assessed using level of income or a measure of individual deprivation. However, the relationship between low income and deprivation is complex—for example, not everyone who has low income is deprived (and vice versa). In addition, longitudinal studies show only a small relationship between short-term changes in income and health but an alternative measure of poverty, such as deprivation, may have a stronger association with health over time. We aim to compare low income and individual deprivation as predictors of self-rated health (SRH), using longitudinal survey data, to test the hypothesis that different measures of poverty may have different associations with health. Methods We used three waves from the longitudinal Survey of Family, Income and Employment and fixed-effect linear regression models to compare low income (¡50\% median income at each wave) and deprivation (reporting three or more items from the New Zealand individual deprivation index) as predictors of SRH (coded 1–5; SD 1.1–1.2). We also compared the impact of duration of low income and deprivation on SRH using mixed linear models. Results In the fixed-effect models, moving into deprivation between waves was associated with a larger decline in SRH compared to moving into low income, which persisted in models including both low income and deprivation. Similar findings were observed for duration of low income and deprivation in mixed models. Conclusions Moving into high levels of individual deprivation is a stronger predictor of changes in SRH than moving into low income. When investigating the association of hardship poverty with health, using alternative measures, in addition to income, is advisable.},

  abstract = {Bounded by the western and eastern syntaxes, the Himalayan region has experienced at least five M ∼ 8 earthquakes during a seismically very active phase from 1897 through 1952. However, there has been a paucity of M ∼ 8 earthquakes since 1952. Examining of various catalogues and seismograms from the Gottingen Observatory, it is established that this quiescence of M ∼ 8 earthquakes is real. While it has not been possible to forecast earthquakes, there has been a success in making a medium term forecast of an M 7.3 earthquake in the adjoining Indo-Burmese arc. Similarly we find that in the central Himalayan region, earthquakes of M ¿ 6.5 have been preceded by seismic swarms and quiescences. In the recent past, based on GPS data, estimates have been made of the accumulated strains and it is postulated that a number of M ∼ 8 earthquakes are imminent in the Himalayan region. We examine these estimates and find that while earthquakes of M ∼ 8 may occur in the region, however, the available GPS data and their interpretation do not necessarily suggest their size and time of occurrence and whether an earthquake in a particular segment will occur sooner in comparison to that in the neighboring segment. We also comment on the inference of occurrence of M ∼ 8 earthquakes based on M8 algorithm for the region. We conclude that while an M ∼ 8 earthquake could occur any time anywhere in the Himalayan region, there is no indication as of now as to where and when it would occur. We impress on the need for preparedness to mitigate the pending earthquake disaster in the region.},

High amenity, environmentally sensitive areas—particularly attractive, non-metropolitan coastal environments—are witnessing a tidal wave of in migration from former urbanites. As a result, these communities are struggling to accommodate growing numbers of people with urban tastes and rural dreams in areas with governance structures and physical infrastructure designed for occasional tourists. This article looks at how governance frameworks in coastal Australia respond to the profound environmental, social, and cultural implications of this process. We offer a typology of non-metropolitan coastal growth settings—from exurban contexts to isolated coastal hamlets—and identify the main environmental, social, economic, and governance issues they face. We then outline the policy and legislative framework governing coastal areas in Australia and show how this framework is interpreted at the local level through an analysis of five local plans covering different coastal settings.},

  abstract = {For a reliable assessment of sustainability in big cities, it is imperative to evaluate urban ecosystem conditions and the environment of the cities undergoing economic growth. Urban green spaces are valuable sources of evapotranspiration, which is generated by trees and vegetation; these spaces mitigate urban heat islands in cities. Land surface temperature (LST) is closely related to the distribution of land-use and land-cover characteristics and can be used as an indicator of urban environment conditions and development. This study evaluates the patterns of LST distribution through time by employing the thermal spatial distribution signature procedure using thermal infrared data obtained from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper. A set of 18 images, between 1985 and 2010, was used to study the urban environment during summer in 47 neighborhoods of Porto Alegre, Brazil. On a neighborhood scale, results show a non-linear inverse correlation (R² = 0.55) between vegetation index and LST. The overall average of the LST is 300.23 K (27.8 °C) with a standard deviation of 1.25 K and the maximum average difference of 2.83 K between neighborhoods. Results show that the Thermal Spatial Distribution Signature (TSDS) analysis can help multi-temporal studies for the evaluation of UHI through time.},

  abstract = {The Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets are a collection of orthorectified, cloud-minimized Landsat-type satellite images, providing near complete coverage of the global land area decadally since the early 1970s. The global mosaics are centered on 1975, 1990, 2000, 2005, and 2010, and consist of data acquired from four sensors: Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, Thematic Mapper, Multispectral Scanner, and Advanced Land Imager. The GLS datasets have been widely used in land-cover and land-use change studies at local, regional, and global scales. This study evaluates the GLS datasets with respect to their spatial coverage, temporal consistency, geodetic accuracy, radiometric calibration consistency, image completeness, extent of cloud contamination, and residual gaps. In general, the three latest GLS datasets are of a better quality than the GLS-1990 and GLS-1975 datasets, with most of the imagery (85\%) having cloud cover of less than 10\%, the acquisition years clustered much more tightly around their target years, better co-registration relative to GLS-2000, and better radiometric absolute calibration. Probably, the most significant impediment to scientific use of the datasets is the variability of image phenology (i.e., acquisition day of year). This paper provides end-users with an assessment of the quality of the GLS datasets for specific applications, and where possible, suggestions for mitigating their deficiencies. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The process of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) varies with latitude, climate, topography and meteorological conditions. This study investigated the seasonal variability of SUHI in the Tehran metropolitan area, Iran, with respect to selected surface biophysical variables. Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Surface Temperature (LST) was retrieved as nighttime LST data, while daytime LST was retrieved from Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) using the split-window algorithm. Both data covered the time period from September 2013 to September 2015. To assess SUHI intensity, we employed three SUHI indicators, i.e., the LST difference of urban-rural, that of urban-agriculture and that of urban-water. Physical and biophysical surface variables, including land use and land cover (LULC), elevation, impervious surface (IS), fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and albedo, were selected to estimate the relationship between LST seasonal variability and the surface properties. Results show that an inversion of the SUHI phenomenon (i.e., surface urban cool island) existed at daytime with the maximal value of urban-rural LST difference of −4 K in March; whereas the maximal value of SUHI at nighttime yielded 3.9 K in May. When using the indicators of urban-agriculture and urban-water LST differences, the maximal value of SUHI was found to be 8.2 K and 15.5 K, respectively. Both results were observed at daytime, suggesting the role of bare soils in the inversion of the SUHI phenomenon with the urban-rural indicator. Maximal correlation was observed in the relationship between night LST and elevation in spring (coefficient: −0.76), night LST and IS in spring (0.60), night LST and albedo in winter (−0.53) and day LST with fractional vegetation cover in summer (−0.41). The relationship between all surface properties with LST possessed large seasonal variations, and thus, using these relationships for SUHI modeling may not be effective. The only exception existed in the correlation between elevation and IS, which may be useful to simulate the SUHI at night. This study suggests that in semi-arid cities, such as Tehran, with the urban-rural indicator, a surface urban cool island may be observed in daytime while SUHI at nighttime; with other indicators, SUHI can be observed in both day and night. Thus, SUHI studies require the acquisition of remote sensing image data at both daytime and nighttime and careful selection of SUHI indicators.},

Whereas the multi-temporal normalization method corrects all images to a selected reference image, in this method images are simultaneously corrected using targets with a range of estimated surface reflectance values.

  abstract = {The aim of this article is to provide a basis in evidence for (or against) the much-quoted assertion that 80\% of all information is geospatially referenced. For this purpose, two approaches are presented that are intended to capture the portion of geospatially referenced information in user-generated content: a network approach and a cognitive approach. In the network approach, the German Wikipedia is used as a research corpus. It is considered a network with the articles being nodes and the links being edges. The Network Degree of Geospatial Reference (NDGR) is introduced as an indicator to measure the network approach. We define NDGR as the shortest path between any Wikipedia article and the closest article within the network that is labeled with coordinates in its headline. An analysis of the German Wikipedia employing this approach shows that 78\% of all articles have a coordinate themselves or are directly linked to at least one article that has geospatial coordinates. The cognitive approach is manifested by the categories of geospatial reference (CGR): direct, indirect, and non-geospatial reference. These are categories that may be distinguished and applied by humans. An empirical study including 380 participants was conducted. The results of both approaches are synthesized with the aim to (1) examine correlations between NDGR and the human conceptualization of geospatial reference and (2) to separate geospatial from non-geospatial information. From the results of this synthesis, it can be concluded that 56-59\% of the articles within Wikipedia can be considered to be directly or indirectly geospatially referenced. The article thus describes a method to check the validity of the '80\%-assertion' for information corpora that can be modeled using graphs (e.g., the World Wide Web, the Semantic Web, and Wikipedia). For the corpus investigated here (Wikipedia), the '80\%-assertion' cannot be confirmed, but would need to be reformulated as a '60\%-assertion'. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

  abstract = {Multiple objective decision support (MODS) is a structured framework for evaluating decision alternatives against multiple, and often conflicting, criteria. Its ability to handle complex trade-offs in a variety of quantitative and qualitative units gives it much potential in the field of natural resource management (NRM). A key component of MODS is the process used to obtain information from decision makers on the relative importance of evaluative criteria. Ranking algorithms then use this information to determine the relative value of each decision alternative. This paper explores how practising community based NRM decision makers respond to five generic methods for weighting the criteria. It presents a study in which 55 decision makers throughout five regions in Queensland, Australia, applied MODS to evaluate environmental projects seeking funding under the Australian Natural Heritage Trust. Weighting methods applied include fixed point scoring, rating, ordinal ranking, a graphical method and paired comparisons. Decision makers evaluated each weighting method in terms of ease of use and of how much it helped clarify the decision problem. Results show that decision makers felt uncomfortable applying fixed point scoring and generally preferred to express their preferences through ordinal ranking. This has implications for the types of ranking algorithms that can be applied to evaluate the decision alternatives.},

However, little is known about how well GIS-based learning lives up to this potential. Using classroom observations, student interviews and surveys, pre and posttests of knowledge, and measures of spatial skills, we have begun to quantify student learning that occurred with a GIS-based module on plate tectonics and geologic hazards. We also investigated factors in the design and implementation of the materials that impacted student learning. Classroom observations were key to improving the materials so that students in an introductory geoscience course can successfully complete the activities with minimal instruction in GIS. Through field-testing, we improved the materials design to address student difficulties with learning to use a GIS, identifying basic geographic locations and features, and interpreting topography and other two- or three- dimensional representations. In a quantitative measure of knowledge, using pretests and posttests, mean scores improved 17\% (p¡.001). We also found positive correlations between students' spatial ability and performance on both the posttest and a regular course exam that covered the material in the GIS activity. We are continuing this investigation in Fall 2001 to measure changes in spatial ability due to use of GIS-based materials.},

  abstract = {Rapid loss estimation after potentially damaging earthquakes is critical for effective emergency response and public information. A methodology and software package, ELER-Earthquake Loss Estimation Routine, for rapid estimation of earthquake shaking and losses throughout the Euro-Mediterranean region was developed under the Joint Research Activity-3 (JRA3) of the EC FP6 Project entitled "Network of Research Infrastructures for European Seismology-NERIES". Recently, a new version (v2.0) of ELER software has been released. The multi-level methodology developed is capable of incorporating regional variability and uncertainty originating from ground motion predictions, fault finiteness, site modifications, inventory of physical and social elements subjected to earthquake hazard and the associated vulnerability relationships. Although primarily intended for quasi real-time estimation of earthquake shaking and losses, the routine is also equally capable of incorporating scenario-based earthquake loss assessments. This paper introduces the urban earthquake loss assessment module (Level 2) of the ELER software which makes use of the most detailed inventory databases of physical and social elements at risk in combination with the analytical vulnerability relationships and building damage-related casualty vulnerability models for the estimation of building damage and casualty distributions, respectively. Spectral capacity-based loss assessment methodology and its vital components are presented. The analysis methods of the Level 2 module, i.e. Capacity Spectrum Method (ATC-40, 1996), Modified Acceleration-Displacement Response Spectrum Method (FEMA 440, 2005), Reduction Factor Method (Fajfar, 2000) and Coefficient Method (ASCE 41-06, 2006), are applied to the selected building types for validation and verification purposes. The damage estimates are compared to the results obtained from the other studies available in the literature, i.e. SELENA v4.0 (Molina et al., 2008) and ATC-55 (Yang, 2005). An urban loss assessment exercise for a scenario earthquake for the city of Istanbul is conducted and physical and social losses are presented. Damage to the urban environment is compared to the results obtained from similar software, i.e. KOERILoss (KOERI, 2002) and DBELA (Crowley et al., 2004). The European rapid loss estimation tool is expected to help enable effective emergency response, on both local and global level, as well as public information.}

We find that in most regions the index is positive, the sense predicted to accompany global warming. In a few regions, especially in Asia and western North America, the index indicates that climate change should be apparent already, but in most places climate trends are too small to stand out above year-to-year variability. The climate index is strongly correlated with global surface temperature, which has increased as rapidly as projected by climate models in the 1980s. We argue that the global area with obvious climate change will increase notably in the next few years. But we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has declined in recent years, and thus there is an opportunity to keep climate change in the 21st century less than “business-as-usual” scenarios.

The paper then proceeds to focus explicitly on Salford, UK, where guerrilla gardening is being encouraged by the local authority. Using ethnographic and interview data, we focus on the actors involved, their relationship with authority and the wider impact of their activities; exploring their motives, aspirations, values and beliefs. The results reveal the ability of the informal movement to regenerate ‘forgotten' space and bring communities together, and the ‘darker' side of the activity, with actors sometimes restricting access to colonised land. Ultimately, the paper reveals how this movement is expanding and that more research is required to better understand the actions of those who pursue a more informal approach to urban gardening and those who seek to regulate land use activity.},

Important issues in the provision of services include the location of the service centers, service capacities, geographical distribution of patients, and ease of access to the health services. This paper describes the development of a discrete-event geographical location–allocation simulation model for evaluating various options for the provision of services.

Daily maximum apparent temperature was interpolated across space via kriging, and aggregated to 29 municipality groups (MGs), a spatial unit composed of municipalities that was designed to have minimal variation in population. Death certificate data were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of excess mortality on days that exceeded the 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of apparent temperature. We find that the average statewide mortality anomalies were 5.11, 6.26, and 7.26 deaths on days exceeding the 85th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of apparent temperature respectively. A linear stepwise regression showed that percent African-American population and percent elderly population (those above the age of 65) were positively associated with an MG's mortality anomaly on days exceeding the 85th percentile of apparent temperature (p ¡ 0.05). In spite of the urban heat island effect, our measure of urbanization was not associated with higher rates of heat-related mortality. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Basic geomorphometric parameters (elevation, slope and curvature) were examined for a pre-release version of G-DEM and SRTM DEM for western Japan. G-DEM has fewer missing cells than SRTM DEM, particularly in steep terrain. Also, G-DEM gives smoother and more realistic representations of lowlands, valleys, steep slopes, and mountain ridges, whereas, SRTM DEM includes many local spikes and holes, and tends to overestimate valley-floor elevation and underestimate ridge elevation. G-DEM will be commonly used in geoscientific studies, because of its higher resolution, fewer missing data, and better topographic representation than SRTM DEM.},

Although traditional spectral-based change-vector analysis (CVA) can effectively detect LULC change in many cases, it encounters difficulties in RUFAs because of deficiencies in the spectral information of satellite images. To detect LULC changes in RUFAs effectively, this paper proposes an extended CVA approach that incorporates textural change information into the traditional spectral-based CVA. The extended CVA was applied to three different pilot RUFAs in China with different remotely sensed data, including Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS) and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) images. The results demonstrated the improvement of the extended CVA compared to the traditional spectral-based CVA with the overall accuracy increased between 4.66\% and 8.00\% and the kappa coefficient increased between 0.10 and 0.15, respectively. The advantage of the extended CVA lies in its integration of both spectral and textural change information to detect LULC changes, allowing for effective discrimination of LULC changes that are spectrally similar but texturally different in RUFAs. The extended CVA has great potential to be widely used for LULC-change detection in RUFAs, which are often heterogeneous and fragmental in nature, with rich textural information. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC \& COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

It is explained with the example of the state of environment indicator ‘LUCCA 4—Urban Areas at Risk of Flooding', how SEA as a decision-aiding instrument can contribute to the prevention of conflicts with policy for adaptation to climate change. The method begins with the determination of impact factors for SEA. In the presented study, the physical impact factors of land consumption, land use change, and directed flooding were recognised. A core problem during the selection of indicators for land uses for the adaptation to climate change (here: LUCCA) and the derivation of assessment thresholds was a lack of region-wide policy objectives for the protection of land and resources. Therefore, in a second step, regional environmental orientation objectives were derived from national and EU environmental policy. A standard method for the selection of LUCCA indicators and the derivation of assessment thresholds for conflict analysis is described. Three classes of conflict classification for regional plan designations on the individual site are proposed. It is recommended that future adaptation measures of regional land use planning should be designations of specific land uses as priority areas for urban areas prone to flood risk.},

  abstract = {The relationship between building damage patterns and human casualties in Nishinomiya City – one of the most heavily damaged cities in the 1995 Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Disaster – was investigated using photographs of damaged buildings. First, the photographs of buildings in which casualties occurred were identified, and the building damage patterns were judged based on the photographs considering the existence of survival space. Then the relationship between the building damage pattern and casualty occurrence, and the characteristics of casualty distribution, were investigated. The main findings were as follows: Most casualties occurred in relatively old two-story wooden buildings in which the ground floor completely collapsed without survival space; casualties occurred at all building damage levels including “no damage”, and it can be seen that building damage is the major, but not the sole cause, of casualties in an earthquake; in Nishinomiya City, the regional distributions of casualties due to the collapse of buildings that left no survival space is similar to that of casualties due to other types of building damage.},

This is of particular relevance for multi-faceted subjects such as geography. Studies on employability have to consider to what degree a university education helps graduates start a career. The results of a survey of 257 geography graduates of JLU (Justus Liebig University) Giessen, Germany, indicate that the traditional curricula did not necessarily prepare German geographers adequately for their jobs. The graduates possess more knowledge than required but lack important competences and transferable skills that the job market demands. This may be partly remedied by the introduction of project-oriented classes. © 2010 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {Many regions of the globe are experiencing rapid urban growth, the location and intensity of which can have negative effects on ecological and social systems. In some locales, planners and policy makers have used urban growth boundaries to direct the location and intensity of development; however the empirical evidence for the efficacy of such policies is mixed. Monitoring the location of urban growth is an essential first step in understanding how the system has changed over time. In addition, if regulations purporting to direct urban growth to specific locales are present, it is important to evaluate if the desired pattern (or change in pattern) has been observed. In this paper, we document land cover and change across six dates (1986, 1991, 1995, 1999, 2002, and 2007) for six counties in the Central Puget Sound, Washington State, USA. We explore patterns of change by three different spatial partitions (the region, each county, 2000 U.S. Census Tracks), and with respect to urban growth boundaries implemented in the late 1990's as part of the state's Growth Management Act. Urban land cover increased from 8 to 19\% of the study area between 1986 and 2007, while lowland deciduous and mixed forests decreased from 21 to 13\% and grass and agriculture decreased from 11 to 8\%. Land in urban classes outside of the urban growth boundaries increased more rapidly (by area and percentage of new urban land cover) than land within the urban growth boundaries, suggesting that the intended effect of the Growth Management Act to direct growth to within the urban growth boundaries may not have been accomplished by 2007. Urban sprawl, as estimated by the area of land per capita, increased overall within the region, with the more rural counties within commuting distance to cities having the highest rate of increase observed. Land cover data is increasingly available and can be used to rapidly evaluate urban development patterns over large areas. Such data are important inputs for policy makers, urban planners, and modelers alike to manage and plan for future population, land use, and land cover changes.},

  abstract = {Accurate characterisation of morphology is critical to many studies in the field of geomorphology, particularly those dealing with changes over time. Digital elevation models (DEMs) are commonly used to represent morphology in three dimensions. The quality of the DEM is largely a function of the accuracy of individual survey points, field survey strategy, and the method of interpolation. Recommendations concerning field survey strategy and appropriate methods of interpolation are currently lacking. Furthermore, the majority of studies to date consider error to be uniform across a surface. This study quantifies survey strategy and interpolation error for a gravel bar on the River Nent, Blagill, Cumbria, UK. Five sampling strategies were compared: (i) cross section; (ii) bar outline only; (iii) bar and chute outline; (iv) bar and chute outline with spot heights; and (v) aerial LiDAR equivalent, derived from degraded terrestrial laser scan (TLS) data. Digital Elevation Models were then produced using five different common interpolation algorithms. Each resultant DEM was differentiated from a terrestrial laser scan of the gravel bar surface in order to define the spatial distribution of vertical and volumetric error. Overall triangulation with linear interpolation (TIN) or point kriging appeared to provide the best interpolators for the bar surface. Lowest error on average was found for the simulated aerial LiDAR survey strategy, regardless of interpolation technique. However, comparably low errors were also found for the bar-chute-spot sampling strategy when TINs or point kriging was used as the interpolator. The magnitude of the errors between survey strategy exceeded those found between interpolation technique for a specific survey strategy. Strong relationships between local surface topographic variation (as defined by the standard deviation of vertical elevations in a 0.2-m diameter moving window), and DEM errors were also found, with much greater errors found at slope breaks such as bank edges. A series of curves are presented that demonstrate these relationships for each interpolation and survey strategy. The simulated aerial LiDAR data set displayed the lowest errors across the flatter surfaces; however, sharp slope breaks are better modelled by the morphologically based survey strategy. The curves presented have general application to spatially distributed data of river beds and may be applied to standard deviation grids to predict spatial error within a surface, depending upon sampling strategy and interpolation algorithm.},

  abstract = {Recent sensor development including high spatial resolution spaceborne systems like IKONOS as well as hyperspectral sensors like AVIRIS have the potential for more detailed and accurate mapping of urban land cover and land use. However, the new spaceborne sensors are limited in their spectral resolution with just four multispectral bands and few studies have focused on the issues of spectral properties of urban materials and their representation and mapping from remote sensing data. The research in this study analyzes the spectral dimension of urban materials from comprehensive field spectra measurements and hyperspectral AVIRIS as well as simulated IKONOS and LANDSAT TM data in 4 m spatial resolution. The results indicate highly complex and diverse spectral properties of urban land cover types. We explore and identify the most suitable wavelengths in mapping urban land cover and show that the spectral separability of urban land cover types is strongly dependent on spectral sensor characteristics. Particularly, IKONOS and LANDSAT TM have specific limitations in accurate separation of several urban land cover categories compared to mapping with AVIRIS that provides an overall accuracy of ∼78\% for a detailed map of urban land cover.},

This paper investigates the unique thematic classes that can be derived using integrated airborne LiDAR and spectral data. The study area consists of a heterogeneous, semi‐natural broadleaf woodland on an ancient site and homogeneous broadleaf and conifer woodland on an adjoining plantation. A parcel‐based unsupervised classification approach was employed, using the first two Principal Components from 12 selected wavebands of HyMap data and a Digital Canopy Height Model extracted from LiDAR data. The resultant 52 data clusters were amalgamated into 10 distinct thematic classes that contain information on species composition and vegetation structure. The thematic classes are relevant to the National Vegetation Classification (NVC) scheme for woodlands and scrub of Great Britain. Furthermore, in distinguishing structural subdivisions within the species‐based NVC classes, the thematic classification provides greater information for quantifying woodland habitat. The classes show degeneration from and regeneration to mature woodland communities and thus reflect the underlying processes of vegetation succession and woodland management. This thematic classification is ecologically relevant and is a forward development in woodland maps created from remote sensing data.}

Method: Comparison of process and outcome measures derived from routinely collected data on hospital admissions and target payments for singlehanded practices and partnerships. Multivariate analysis was used to adjust for the confounding effects of general practice characteristics—deprivation (Townsend score), percentage of Asian residents, percentage of black residents, proportion of men over 75 years, proportion of women over 75 years, rurality, presence of a female general practitioner, and vocational training status. Results: Differences in achievement of immunisation and cytology targets apparent on univariate analysis were not seen after adjustment for other general practice characteristics. Similarly, significant differences (¿15\%; P¡0.01) for three types of hospital admission seen on univariate analysis were not present after adjustment for other practice characteristics. Conclusions: This study provides no evidence that singlehanded general practitioners are underperforming clinically. Our results offer insight into the structural difference between the two types of practice and underline the importance of the effect of other practice characteristics on process and outcome measures.

  abstract = {This study investigates the quality (in terms of elevation accuracy and systematic errors) of three recent publicly available elevation model datasets over Australia: (i) the 9 arc second national GEODATA DEM-9S ver3 from Geoscience Australia and the Australian National University; (ii) the 3 arc second SRTM ver4.1 from CGIAR-CSI; and (iii) the 1 arc second ASTER-GDEM ver1 from NASA/METI. The main features of these datasets are reported from a geodetic point of view. Comparison at about 1 billion locations identifies artefacts (e.g. residual cloud patterns and stripe effects) in ASTER. For DEM-9S, the comparisons against the space-collected SRTM and ASTER models demonstrate that signal omission (due to the ∼270 m spacing) may cause errors of the order of 100–200 m in some rugged areas of Australia. Based on a set of geodetic ground control points over Western Australia, the vertical accuracy of DEM-9S is ∼9 m, SRTM ∼6 m and ASTER ∼15 m. However, these values vary as a function of the terrain type and shape. Thus, CGIAR-CSI SRTM ver4.1 may represent a viable alternative to DEM-9S for some applications. While ASTER GDEM has an unprecedented horizontal resolution of ∼30 m, systematic errors present in this research-grade version of the ASTER GDEM ver1 will impede its immediate use for some applications.}

  abstract = {Land cover classification plays a key role for various geo-based applications. Many approaches for the classification of remote sensing data assume the features of neighboring image sites to be conditionally independent. However, using spatial and temporal context information may enhance classification accuracy. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) have the ability to model dependencies not only between the class labels of neighboring image sites, but also between the labels and the image features. In this work we present a novel approach for multitemporal classification in high resolution satellite imagery using CRF that is based on an extension of the CRF model by a time-dependant component. The potential of our approach is demonstrated using a set of two Ikonos and one RapidEye scenes of a rural area in Germany.},

  abstract = {The grain-scale morphology of fluvial sediments is an important control on the character and dynamics of river systems; however current understanding of its role is limited by the difficulties of robustly quantifying field surface morphology. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) offers a new methodology for the rapid acquisition of high-resolution and high-precision surface elevation data from in situ sediments. To date, most environmental and fluvial applications of TLS have focused on large-scale systems, capturing macroscale morphologies. Application of this new technology at scales necessary to characterize the complexity of grain-scale fluvial sediments therefore requires a robust assessment of the quality and sources of errors in close-range TLS data. This paper describes both laboratory and field experiments designed to evaluate close-range TLS for sedimentological applications and to develop protocols for data acquisition. In the former, controlled experiments comprising high-resolution scans of white, grey and black planes and a sphere were used to quantify the magnitude and source of three-dimensional (3D) point errors resulting from a combination of surface geometry, reflectivity effects and inherent instrument precision. Subsequently, a methodology for the collection and processing of grain-scale TLS data is described through an application to a coarse grained gravel system, the River Feshie (D50 32 to 63 mm). This stepwise strategy incorporates averaging repeat scans and filtering scan artefact and non-surface points using local 3D search algorithms. The sensitivity of the results to the filter parameter values are assessed by careful internal validation of Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) created from the resulting point cloud data. The transferability of this methodology is assessed through application to a second river, Bury Green Brook, dominated by finer gravel (D50 18 to 33 mm). The factor limiting the resolution of DTMs created from this second dataset was found to be the relative sizes of the laser footprint and smallest grains. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Abstract: Fire danger rating systems commonly ignore fine scale, topographically-induced weather variations. These variations will likely create heterogeneous, landscape-scale fire danger conditions that have never been examined in detail. We modeled the evolution of fuel moistures and the Energy Release Component (ERC) from the US National Fire Danger Rating System across the 2009 fire season using very high resolution (30m) surface air temperature, humidity and snow ablation date models developed from a network of inexpensive weather sensors. Snow ablation date occurred as much as 28days later on North-facing slopes than on South-facing slopes at upper elevations. South-facing slopes were hotter and drier than North-facing slopes but slope position, in addition to aspect, was also important because nocturnal air temperatures were coolest and humidity was highest in valley bottoms. These factors created heterogeneous fuel moistures and fire danger across the study area. In the late season (August and September), nocturnal cold air drainage and high relative humidity fostered fuel moisture recovery in valley bottoms, where fuel moistures and ERC values were 30\% and 45\% higher and lower, respectively at peak fire danger (September 29th). Dry fuel moistures and relatively high ERC values persisted on low elevation, South-facing slopes. The driest conditions were observed 100–200m above the valley floor where mid-slope thermal belts frequently developed above areas of cold air pooling. We suggest that a complete understanding of these variations may help improve fire management decision making.},

The objectives of this multi-layer, multi-source database are two fold: first, to provide consistent land cover for all 50 States, and second, to provide a data framework which allows flexibility in developing and applying each independent data component to a wide variety of other applications. Components in the database include the following: (1) normalized imagery for three time periods per path/row, (2) ancillary data, including a 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) derived into slope, aspect and slope position, (3) perpixel estimates of percent imperviousness and percent tree canopy, (4) 29 classes of land cover data derived from the imagery, ancillary data, and derivatives, (5) classification rules, confidence estimates, and metadata from the land cover classification. This database is now being developed using a Mapping Zone approach, with 66 Zones in the continental United States and 23 Zones in Alaska. Results from three initial mapping Zones show single-pixel land cover accuracies ranging from 73 to 77 percent, imperviousness accuracies ranging from 83 to 91 percent, tree canopy accuracies ranging from 78 to 93 percent, and an estimated 50 percent increase in mapping efficiency over previous methods. The database has now entered the production phase and is being created using extensive partnering in the Federal government with planned completion by 2006.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed multitemporal, multisensor data are often required in Earth observation applications. A common problem associated with the use of multisource image data is the grey value differences caused by non‐surface factors such as different illumination, atmospheric, or sensor conditions. Such differences make it difficult to compare images using the same colour metric system. Image normalization is required to reduce the radiometric influences caused by non‐surface factors and to ensure that the grey value differences between temporal images reflect actual changes on the surface of the Earth.A variety of image normalization methods, such as pseudoinvariant features (PIF), dark and bright set (DB), simple regression (SR), no‐change set determined from scattergrams (NC), and histogram matching (HM), have been published in scientific journals. These methods have been tested with either Landsat TM data, MSS data or both, and test results differ from author to author. However, whether or not existing methods could be adopted for normalizing high resolution multispectral satellite images, such as IKONOS and QuickBird, is still open for discussion because of the dramatic change in spatial resolution and the difference of available multispectral bands. In this research, the existing methods are introduced and employed to normalize the radiometric difference between IKONOS and QuickBird multispectral images taken in different years. Some improvements are introduced to the existing methods to overcome problems caused by band difference and to achieve more stable and better results. The normalized results are compared in terms of visual inspection and statistical analysis. This paper examined whether or not existing methods can be directly adopted for image normalization with high resolution satellite images, and showed how these methods can be modified for use with such images.}

  abstract = {Support vector machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary classification. How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue. Several methods have been proposed where typically we construct a multiclass classifier by combining several binary classifiers. Some authors also proposed methods that consider all classes at once. As it is computationally more expensive to solve multiclass problems, comparisons of these methods using large-scale problems have not been seriously conducted. Especially for methods solving multiclass SVM in one step, a much larger optimization problem is required so up to now experiments are limited to small data sets. In this paper we give decomposition implementations for two such "all-together" methods. We then compare their performance with three methods based on binary classifications: "one-against-all," "one-against-one," and directed acyclic graph SVM (DAGSVM). Our experiments indicate that the "one-against-one" and DAG methods are more suitable for practical use than the other methods. Results also show that for large problems methods by considering all data at once in general need fewer support vectors.},

  abstract = {The studies of impervious surfaces are important because they are related to many environmental problems, such as water quality, stream health, and the urban heat island effect. Previous studies have discussed that the self-organizing map (SOM) can provide a promising alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural networks for image classification at both per-pixel and sub-pixel level. However, the performances of SOM and MLP have not been compared in the estimation and mapping of urban impervious surfaces. In mid-latitude areas, plant phenology has a significant influence on remote sensing of the environment. When the neural networks approaches are applied, how satellite images acquired in different seasons impact impervious surface estimation of various urban surfaces (such as commercial, residential, and suburban/rural areas) remains to be answered. In this paper, an SOM and an MLP neural network were applied to three ASTER images acquired on April 5, 2004, June 16, 2001, and October 3, 2000, respectively, which covered Marion County, Indiana, United States. Six impervious surface maps were yielded, and an accuracy assessment was performed. The root mean square error (RMSE), the mean average error (MAE), and the coefficient of determination (R2) were calculated to indicate the accuracy of impervious surface maps. The results indicated that the SOM can generate a slightly better estimation of impervious surfaces than the MLP. Moreover, the results from three test areas showed that, in the residential areas, more accurate results were yielded by the SOM, which indicates that the SOM was more effective in coping with the mixed pixels than the MLP, because the residential area prevailed with mixed pixels. Results obtained from the commercial area possessed very high RMSE values due to the prevalence of shade, which indicates that both algorithms cannot handle the shade problem well. The lowest RMSE value was obtained from the rural area due to containing of less mixed pixels and shade. This research supports previous observations that the SOM can provide a promising alternative to the MLP neural network. This study also found that the impact of different map sizes on the impervious surface estimation is significant. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Allocation for earthquake emergency shelters is a complicated geographic optimization problem because it involves multiple sites, strict constraints, and discrete feasible domain. Huge solution space makes the problem computationally intractable. Traditional brute-force methods can obtain exact optimal solutions. However, it is not sophisticated enough to solve the complex optimization problem with reasonable time especially in high-dimensional solution space. Artificial intelligent algorithms hold the promise of improving the effectiveness of location search. This article proposes a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to deal with the allocation problem of earthquake emergency shelter. A new discrete PSO and the feasibility-based rule are incorporated according to the discrete solution space and strict constraints. In addition, for enhancing search capability, simulated annealing (SA) algorithm is employed to escape from local optima. The modified algorithm has been applied to the allocation of earthquake emergency shelters in the Zhuguang Block of Guangzhou City, China. The experiments have shown that the algorithm can identify the number and locations of emergency shelters. The modified PSO algorithm shows a better performance than other hybrid algorithms presented in the article, and is an effective approach for the allocation problem of earthquake emergency shelters.}

  abstract = {High spatial resolution urban climate modeling is essential for understanding urban climatology and predicting the human health impacts under climate change. Satellite thermal remote-sensing data are potential observational sources for urban climate model validation with comparable spatial scales, temporal consistency, broad coverage, and long-term archives. However, sensor view angle, cloud distribution, and cloud-contaminated pixels can confound comparisons between satellite land surface temperature (LST) and modeled surface radiometric temperature. The impacts of sensor view angles on urban LST values are investigated and addressed. Three methods to minimize the confounding factors of clouds are proposed and evaluated using 10 years of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and simulations from the High-Resolution Land Data Assimilation System (HRLDAS) over Greater Houston, Texas, U.S. For the satellite cloud mask (SCM) method, prior to comparison, the cloud mask for each MODIS scene is applied to its concurrent HRLDAS simulation. For the max/min temperature (MMT) method, the 50 warmest days and coolest nights for each data set are selected and compared to avoid cloud impacts. For the high clear-sky fraction (HCF) method, only those MODIS scenes that have a high percentage of clear-sky pixels are compared. The SCM method is recommended for validation of long-term simulations because it provides the largest sample size as well as temporal consistency with the simulations. The MMT method is best for comparison at the extremes. And the HCF method gives the best absolute temperature comparison due to the spatial and temporal consistency between simulations and observations.},

  abstract = {High-resolution urban land use maps have important applications in urban planning and management, but the availability of these maps is low in countries such as China. To address this issue, we have developed a protocol to identify urban land use functions over large areas using satellite images and open social data. We first derived parcels from road networks contained in Open Street Map (OSM) and used the parcels as the basic mapping unit. We then used 10 features derived from Points of Interest (POI) data and two indices obtained from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to classify parcels into eight Level I classes and sixteen Level II classes of land use. Similarity measures and threshold methods were used to identify land use types in the classification process. This protocol was tested in Beijing, China. The results showed that the generated land use map had an overall accuracy of 81.04\% and 69.89\% for Level I and Level II classes, respectively. The map revealed significantly more details of the spatial pattern of land uses in Beijing than the land use map released by the government.},

  abstract = {In recent years, it has been widely agreed that spatial features derived from textural, structural, and object-based methods are important information sources to complement spectral properties for accurate urban classification of high-resolution imagery. However, the spatial features always refer to a series of parameters, such as scales, directions, and statistical measures, leading to high-dimensional feature space. The high-dimensional space is almost impractical to deal with considering the huge storage and computational cost while processing high-resolution images. To this aim, we propose a novel multi-index learning (MIL) method, where a set of low-dimensional information indices is used to represent the complex geospatial scenes in high-resolution images. Specifically, two categories of indices are proposed in the study: (1) Primitive indices (PI): High-resolution urban scenes are represented using a group of primitives (e.g., building/shadow/vegetation) that are calculated automatically and rapidly; (2) Variation indices (VI): A couple of spectral and spatial variation indices are proposed based on the 3D wavelet transformation in order to describe the local variation in the joint spectral-spatial domains. In this way, urban landscapes can be decomposed into a set of low-dimensional and semantic indices replacing the high-dimensional but low-level features (e.g., textures). The information indices are then learned via the multi-kernel support vector machines. The proposed MIL method is evaluated using various high-resolution images including GeoEye-1, QuickBird, WorldView-2, and ZY-3, as well as an elaborate comparison to the state-of-the-art image classification algorithms such as object-based analysis, and spectral-spatial approaches based on textural and morphological features. It is revealed that the MIL method is able to achieve promising results with a low-dimensional feature space, and, provide a practical strategy for processing large-scale high-resolution images. ?? 2014 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  abstract = {Light detection and ranging (lidar) data provide accurate measurements of forest canopy structure in the vertical plane; however, current lidar sensors have limited coverage in the horizontal plane. Landsat data provide extensive coverage of generalized forest structural classes in the horizontal plane but are relatively insensitive to variation in forest canopy height. It would, therefore, be desirable to integrate lidar and Landsat data to improve the measurement, mapping, and monitoring of forest structural attributes. We tested five aspatial and spatial methods for predicting canopy height, using an airborne lidar system (Aeroscan) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data: regression, kriging, cokriging, and kriging and cokriging of regression residuals. Our 200-km2 study area in western Oregon encompassed Oregon State University's McDonald–Dunn Research Forest, which is broadly representative of the age and structural classes common in the region. We sampled a spatially continuous lidar coverage in eight systematic patterns to determine which lidar sampling strategy would optimize lidar–Landsat integration in western Oregon forests: transects sampled at 2000, 1000, 500, and 250 m frequencies, and points sampled at these same spatial frequencies. The aspatial regression model results, regardless of sampling strategy, preserved actual vegetation pattern, but underestimated taller canopies and overestimated shorter canopies. The spatial models, kriging and cokriging, produced less biased results than regression but poorly reproduced vegetation pattern, especially at the sparser (2000 and 1000 m) sampling frequencies. The spatial model predictions were more accurate than the regression model predictions at locations ¡200 m from sample locations. Cokriging, using the ETM+ panchromatic band as the secondary variable, proved slightly more accurate than kriging. The integrated models that kriged or cokriged regression residuals were preferable to either the aspatial or spatial models alone because they preserved the vegetation pattern like regression yet improved estimation accuracies above those predicted from the regression models alone. The 250-m point sampling strategy proved most optimal because it oversampled the landscape relative to the geostatistical range of actual spatial variation, as indicated by the sample semivariograms, while making the sample data volume more manageable. We concluded that an integrated modeling strategy is most suitable for estimating and mapping canopy height at locations unsampled by lidar, and that a 250-m discrete point sampling strategy most efficiently samples an intensively managed forested landscape in western Oregon.}

An approach to calibrate the model by associating the model parameters with the physical catchment characteristics was implemented. Land use, soil type, catchment size, and topographic structure were used as the bases for regionalization of the model parameters. Parameter values were initially associated with these catchment characteristics and were finally transferred into their catchment scale values using a transfer function, whose form was assumed a priori. A simultaneous model calibration was performed for a number of catchments with contrasting catchment characteristics. An optimization algorithm was used for the calibration with an objective function defined as the normalized sum of the squared differences between the modeled and the observed runoff. The regionalized model thus obtained was then used to model the resulting runoff for different land use scenarios generated in the model area. The results obtained suggest that increased urbanization leads to an increase in the lower peak runoff resulting from summer storm, while the increase in the higher peaks resulting from winter rainfall is very little. On the other hand, a considerable reduction of both the peak runoff and the total runoff volume resulted from intensified afforestation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Thresholding was required to adapt the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP/OLS)-based NGDC data set into an urban map because the values reported in the prototype represent a cumulative percentage lighted for each pixel extracted from hundreds of nighttime cloud-screened orbits, rather than any suitable land-cover classification. The cumulative percentage lighted data could not be used alone because the very high gain of the OLS nighttime photomultiplier configuration can lead to a pixel (2.7x2.7 km) appearing 'lighted' even with very low intensity, nonurban light sources. We found that a threshold of ???89\% yielded the best results, removing ephemeral light sources and 'blooming' of light onto water when adjacent to cities while still leaving the dense urban core intact. This approach gave very good results when compared with the urban areas as defined by the 1990 U.S. Census; the 'urban' area from our analysis being only 5\% less than that of the Census. The Census was also used to derive population- and housing-density statistics for the continent-wide 'city lights' analysis; these averaged 1033 persons/km2 and 426 housing units/km2, respectively. The use of a nighttime sensor to determine the location and estimate the density of population based on light sources has proved feasible in this exploratory effort. However, issues concerning the use of census data as a benchmark for evaluating the accuracy of remotely sensed imagery are discussed, and potential improvements in the sensor regarding spatial resolution, instrument gain, and pointing accuracy are addressed.},

Development intensity zones based on \%ISA are defined for each urban area emanating outward from the urban core to the non-urban rural areas nearby and used to stratify sampling for land surface temperatures and NDVI. Sampling is further constrained by biome and elevation to insure objective intercomparisons between zones and between cities in different biomes permitting the definition of hierarchically ordered zones that are consistent across urban areas in different ecological setting and across scales. We find that ecological context significantly influences the amplitude of summer daytime UHI (urban-rural temperature difference) the largest (8 ??C average) observed for cities built in biomes dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. For all cities combined, ISA is the primary driver for increase in temperature explaining 70\% of the total variance in LST. On a yearly average, urban areas are substantially warmer than the non-urban fringe by 2.9 ??C, except for urban areas in biomes with arid and semiarid climates. The average amplitude of the UHI is remarkably asymmetric with a 4.3 ??C temperature difference in summer and only 1.3 ??C in winter. In desert environments, the LST's response to ISA presents an uncharacteristic "U-shaped" horizontal gradient decreasing from the urban core to the outskirts of the city and then increasing again in the suburban to the rural zones. UHI's calculated for these cities point to a possible heat sink effect. These observational results show that the urban heat island amplitude both increases with city size and is seasonally asymmetric for a large number of cities across most biomes. The implications are that for urban areas developed within forested ecosystems the summertime UHI can be quite high relative to the wintertime UHI suggesting that the residential energy consumption required for summer cooling is likely to increase with urban growth within those biomes.},

It is, for example, important for issues such as wildlife habitat modeling and close-to-nature forest management. We examined the suitability of 8-band WorldView-2 satellite data for the identification of 10 tree species in a temperate forest in Austria. We performed a Random Forest (RF) classification (object-based and pixel-based) using spectra of manually delineated sunlit regions of tree crowns. The overall accuracy for classifying 10 tree species was around 82\% (8 bands, object-based). The class-specific producer's accuracies ranged between 33\% (European hornbeam) and 94\% (European beech) and the user's accuracies between 57\% (European hornbeam) and 92\% (Lawson's cypress). The object-based approach outperformed the pixel-based approach. We could show that the 4 new WorldView-2 bands (Coastal, Yellow, Red Edge, and Near Infrared 2) have only limited impact on classification accuracy if only the 4 main tree species (Norway spruce, Scots pine, European beech, and English oak) are to be separated. However, classification accuracy increased significantly using the full spectral resolution if further tree species were included. Beside the impact on overall classification accuracy, the importance of the spectral bands was evaluated with two measures provided by RF. An in-depth analysis of the RF output was carried out to evaluate the impact of reference data quality and the resulting reliability of final class assignments. Finally, an extensive literature review on tree species classification comprising about 20 studies is presented.},

  abstract = {Geographic information systems (GIS) have been integrated to many applications in facility location problems today. However, there are still some GIS capabilities yet to be explored thoroughly. This study utilizes the capability of GIS to generate service areas as the travel time zones in a facility location model called the maximal service area problem (MSAP). The model is addressed to emergency facilities for which accessibility is an important requirement. The objective of the MSAP is to maximize the total service area of a specified number of facilities. In the MSAP, continuous space is deemed as the demand area, thus the optimality was measured by how large the area could be served by a set of facilities. Fire stations in South Jakarta, Indonesia, were chosen as a case study. Three heuristics, genetic algorithm (GA), tabu search (TS) and simulated annealing (SA), were applied to solve the optimization problem of the MSAP. The final output of the study shows that the three heuristics managed to provide better coverage than the existing coverage with the same number of fire stations within the same travel time. GA reached 82.95\% coverage in 50.60 min, TS did 83.20\% in 3.73 min, and SA did 80.17\% in 52.42 min, while the existing coverage only reaches 73.82\%.}

As Section 8.4 emphasizes, this will require responses by all levels of government as well as individuals and communities, the private sector, and civil society. The serious impacts of extreme weather on many urban centers each year demonstrate some of the risks and vulnerabilities to be addressed (UNISDR, 2009; IFRC, 2010). Climate change will usually add to these and other risks and vulnerabilities. Urban policies also have major implications for mitigation, especially for future levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and for delivering co-benefits, as discussed in WGIII AR5. This chapter focuses on the possibilities for governments, enterprises, and populations to adapt urban centers to the direct and indirect impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) aboard Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) is a spaceborne LiDAR sensor. It is the first LiDAR instrument which can digitize the backscattered waveform and offer near global coverage. Among others, scientific objectives of the mission include precise measurement of vegetation canopy heights. Existing approaches of waveform processing for canopy height estimation suggest Gaussian decomposition of the waveform which has the limitation to properly characterize significant peaks and results in discrepant information. Moreover, in most cases, Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) are required for canopy height estimation. This paper presents a new automated method of GLAS waveform processing for extracting vegetation canopy height in the absence of a DTM. Canopy heights retrieved from GLAS waveforms were validated with field measured heights. The newly proposed method was able to explain 79\% of variation in canopy heights with an RMSE of 3.18 m, in the study area. The unexplained variation in canopy heights retrieved from GLAS data can be due to errors introduced by footprint eccentricity, decay of energy between emitted and received signals, uncertainty in the field measurements and limited number of sampled footprints. Results achieved with the newly proposed method were encouraging and demonstrated its potential of processing full-waveform LiDAR data for estimating forest canopy height. The study also had implications on future full-waveform spaceborne missions and their utility in vegetation studies.},

Its magnitude is related to city size, especially under cloudless sky conditions on a regional basis, although individual cities may be impacted by such local factors as proximity to large water bodies or prevailing winds. The UHI pattern in the small city of Ljutomer was examined in order to assess its intensity and morphology and to test the utility of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method in modeling the regression relationships between mean air temperature and related influence factors in this small-scale urban example. Significant differences in mean air temperature between urban and rural areas were measured. It turned out that built-up areas in Ljutomer are on average 1°C warmer than the rural surroundings in winter time. The regression analyses confirmed the important role of local non-stationary explanatory variables - distance to urban area, topographic position index and land-cover diversity - and global stationary variables - building volume per area and northness - in explaining spatial variation in mean air temperature. The relationships between mean air temperature and these five explanatory variables produced an overall model fit of 91\%, utilizing the semiparametric GWR method, which was tested on the smallest scale so far published. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The great earthquake belt which stretches from the Mediterranean through the Middle East into Central Asia results from the ongoing collision between the Eurasian plate and the African, Arabian and Indian plates to the south. Through much of this belt, the topography is created and controlled by fault movement in earthquakes. Many habitations are located at the foot of the fault-controlled mountain range-fronts that bound inhospitable deserts or elevated plateaus, in positions that are favourable for trade-routes, strategic control of access or for water supply. As a result, they are vulnerable to earthquakes, which often seem to have targeted population centres precisely. For many centuries, an uneasy accommodation was reached between human needs and the earthquake-controlled landscape, sometimes brilliantly exploited by local hydrological engineering, as in Iran. Occasional earthquakes would occur, killing a shocking proportion of the population, but the populations of the settlements themselves would be relatively small. Many once-small rural communities have now grown into towns, cities or megacities, while retaining their vulnerability through poor building standards. Earthquakes that occur in these places today now kill many more than they did in the past, as we have witnessed in the last few years. Extreme catastrophes have been rare only because the exposure of modern megacities to earthquake hazards has been relatively short (approx. 50 years); an increase in the number of such catastrophes now seems to be inevitable.},

This paper investigates best practice in the classroom and placement activities which develop employability skills and identifies factors impeding skill performance during WIL, based on survey data from 131 undergraduates across different disciplines in an Australian university. What students actually experienced during placement, or what they felt was important to their learning, broadly aligns with best practice principles for WIL programs and problems experienced in performing certain skills during placement can be largely attributed to poor design. Implications for academic and professional practitioners are discussed.},

Central to this is the use of weekly on-line formative tests that students are expected to complete in their own time. Whilst over-all module pass rates remain stable, results indicate that a substantial proportion of students completed all of these assessments, and this appears to be directly linked to attainment of higher grades. Student feedback indicated that over 80\% of responding students found the tests helpful.

  abstract = {A forest fire can be a real ecological disaster, regardless of whether it is caused by natural forces or human activity. It is impossible to control nature, but it is possible to map forest fire risk zones and thereby minimise the frequency of fire, avert damage, etc. Forest fire risk zones are locations where a fire is likely to start, and from where it can easily spread to other areas. Anticipation of factors influencing the occurrence of fire and understanding the dynamic behaviour of fire are critical aspects of fire management. A precise evaluation of forest fire problems and decisions on solution methods can only be satisfactorily made when a fire risk zone map is available. Satellite data plays a vital role in identifying and mapping forest fires and in recording the frequency at which different vegetation types/zones are affected. A geographic information system (GIS) can be used effectively to combine different forest-fire-causing factors for demarcating the forest fire risk zone map. Gorna Subwatershed, located in Madhya Pradesh, India, was selected for this study because it continually faces a forest fire problem. A colour composite image from the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS) 1D LISS III was used for vegetation mapping. Slope and other coverages (roads and settlements) were derived from topographic maps and field information. The thematic and topographic information was digitised and ARC/INFO GIS software was used for analysis. Forest fire risk zones were delineated by assigning subjective weights to the classes of all the layers according to their sensitivity to fire or their fire-inducing capability. Four categories of forest fire risk ranging from very high to low were derived automatically. Almost 30\% of the study area was predicted to be under very high and high-risk zones. The evolved GIS-based forest fire risk model of the study area was found to be in strong agreement with actual fire-affected sites.},

  abstract = {Declining water quality in the Chesapeake Bay estuary is in part the result of disruptions in the hydrological system caused by urban and suburban development throughout its 167000 km(2) watershed. A modeling system that could provide regional assessments of future development and explore the potential impacts of different regional management scenarios would be useful for a wide range of applications relevant to the future health of the Bay and its tributaries. We describe and test a regional predictive modeling system that could be used to meet these needs. An existing cellular automaton model, SLEUTH, was applied to a 23 700 km(2) area centered on the Washington - Baltimore metropolitan region, which has experienced rapid land-use change in recent years. The model was calibrated using a historic time series of developed areas derived from remote sensing imagery, and future growth was projected out to 2030 assuming three different policy scenarios: (1) current trends, (2) managed growth, and (3) ecologically sustainable growth. The current trends scenario allowed areas on the urban fringe that are currently rural or forested to be developed, which would have implications for water quality in the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. The managed growth and ecologically sustainable scenarios produced growth patterns that were more constrained and which consumed less natural resource land. This application of the SLEUTH model demonstrates an ability to address a range of regional planning issues, but spatial accuracy and scale sensitivity are among the factors that must be further considered for practical application.},

This new TIR sensor (TIRS) includes two TIR bands in the atmospheric window between 10 and 12 𝜇m, thus allowing the application of split-window (SW) algorithms in addition to single-channel (SC) algorithms or direct inversions of the radiative transfer equation used in previous sensors on board the Landsat platforms, with only one TIR band. In this letter, we propose SC and SW algorithms to be applied to Landsat-8 TIRS data for LST retrieval. Algorithms were tested with simulated data obtained from forward simulations using atmospheric profile databases and emissivity spectra extracted from spectral libraries. Results show mean errors typically below 1.5 K for both SC and SW algorithms, with slightly better results for the SW algorithm than for the SC algorithm with increasing atmospheric water vapor contents.},

Since the initiation from the early 1970s, a total of nine meteorological satellites, FY series, including five polar-orbit satellites and four geostationary satellites, have been successfully launched. Chinese FY has become an important component of global meteorological satellites systems and continues to maintain long-term stable operations of both polar and stationary meteorological satellites. Later in 2002, China's HY-1, an oceanic color satellite, was launched and is now in good operation. The successive HY-2 and HY-3 of the HY series, including microwave sensors, are also on schedule. Relevant basic research, application, and operational service of satellite-borne remote sensing and Earth observation have been well implemented. In this paper, a brief overview of Chinese satellite-borne remote sensing, FY and HY series, is presented, and some progress is introduced.},

  abstract = {Icelandic glaciers cover ∼11 000 km2 in area and store ∼3600 km3 of ice. Starting in 2008 during the International Polar Year, accurate digital elevation models (DEMs) of the glaciers are being produced with airborne lidar. More than 90\% of the glaciers have been surveyed in this effort, including Vatnajökull, Hofsjökull, Mýrdalsjökull, Drangajökull, Eyjafjallajökull and several smaller glaciers. The publicly available DEMs are useful for glaciological and geological research, including studies of ice-volume changes, estimation of bias in mass-balance measurements, studies of jökulhlaups and subglacial lakes formed by subglacial geothermal areas, and for mapping of crevasses. The lidar mapping includes a 500–1000 m wide ice-free buffer zone around the ice margins which contains many glacio-geomorphological features, and therefore the new DEMs have proved useful in geological investigations of proglacial areas. Comparison of the lidar DEMs with older maps confirms the rapid ongoing volume changes of the Icelandic ice caps which have been shown by mass-balance measurements since 1995/96. In some cases, ice-volume changes derived by comparing the lidar measurements with older DEMs are in good agreement with accumulated ice-volume changes derived from traditional mass-balance measurements, but in other cases such a comparison indicates substantial biases in the traditional mass-balance records.}

  abstract = {We explored the potential for rapid land use/land cover (LULC) mapping using time-series Landsat satellite imagery and training data (for supervised classification) automatically extracted from crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) "landuse" (OSM-LU) and "natural" (OSM-N) polygon datasets. The main challenge with using these data for LULC classification was their high level of noise, as the Landsat images all contained varying degrees of cloud cover (causes of attribute noise) and the OSM polygons contained locational errors and class labeling errors (causes of class noise). A second challenge arose from the imbalanced class distribution in the extracted training data, which occurred due to wide discrepancies in the area coverage of each OSM-LU/OSM-N class. To address the first challenge, three relatively noise-tolerant algorithms - naïve bayes (NB), decision tree (C4.5 algorithm), and random forest (RF) - were evaluated for image classification. To address the second challenge, artificial training samples were generated for the minority classes using the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE). Image classification accuracies were calculated for a four-class, five-class, and six-class LULC system to assess the capability of the proposed methods for mapping relatively broad as well as more detailed LULC types, and the highest overall accuracies achieved were 84.0\% (four-class SMOTE-RF result), 81.0\% (five-class SMOTE-RF result), and 72.0\% (six-class SMOTE-NB result). RF and NB had relatively similar overall accuracies, while those of C4.5 were much lower. SMOTE led to higher classification accuracies for RF and C4.5, and in some cases for NB, despite the noise in the training set. The main advantages of the proposed methods are their cost- and time-efficiency, as training data for supervised classification is automatically extracted from the crowdsourced datasets and no pre-processing for cloud detection/cloud removal is performed.},

  abstract = {The potential of Landsat data processing to provide systematic continental scale products has been demonstrated by several projects including the NASA Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the MODIS Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The LEDAPS method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with AERONET corrected ETM+ data for 95 10. km. ??. 10. km 30. m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30. m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the LEDAPS method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Reading these pedagogies through ecosophy allows us to name more fully the troubling assumptions and lacunae of these pedagogical strategies. The chapter also explores connections between individuals, communities, practices, and the nonhuman (material) world. Finally, the chapter argues not only that education is a matter of connection to people and communities, but also that education involves an exploration and reimagining of our connections to things, processes, and living systems.},

There are eight species of mangrove trees, of which Rhizophora mucronata and Ceriops tagal are dominant. The standing volume ranges between 6.85 to 710.0 m3 ha−1 for stem with diameter above 5.0 cm. The average volume of the entire study area was 145.88 m3 ha−1, which corresponds to a stocking rate of 1736 stems per ha.

Cameras can augment these data by transmitting images of high-risk areas into the graphical interface of the system. Furthermore, the system provides the geographical representation of fire ignition probability and identifies high-risk areas at different local regions daily, based on a high performance computing (HPC) pilot application that runs on Windows HPC Server. Real-time data from remote automatic weather stations and weather maps based on a weather forecasting system provide vital weather data needed for fire prevention and early warning. By using these methods and a variety of fire management information and tools, the end-users are given the ability to design an operational plan to encompass the forest fire, choosing the best ways to put the fire out within the proper recourses and time.},

The main tools are remote sensing data and geographical information system (GIS) to obtain a macro view of Singapore and carry out comprehensive analysis at the same time. The data were analyzed by utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods. Both the qualitative and quantitative analysis results show that the land usage will influence urban temperature. In the daytime, the order of surface temperature in different land use types is industrial, commercial, airport, residential, and park respectively. However, during the night time, the order is commercial, residential, park, industrial, and airport. Therefore, with appropriate land use planning, the urban heat island (UHI) could be mitigated. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In steep and rocky terrains, their rough surfaces make it difficult to create landslide inventories even with detailed maps/images produced from airborne LiDAR data. To provide objective clues in locating deep-seated landslides, the surface textures of a 5 km2 steepland area in Japan was investigated using the eigenvalue ratio and slope filters calculated from a very high resolution LiDAR-derived DEM. The range of filter values was determined for each of a number of surface features mapped in the field and these included: cracked bedrock outcrops, coarse colluvial deposits, gently undulating surfaces, and smooth surfaces. Recently active slides commonly contained patches of ground in which deposition and erosion occurred together near the erosion front, or where cracked bedrock outcrops and coarse colluvial deposits coexisted under a gently undulating surface. The characteristic eigenvalue and slope filter values representing this sliding process were applied to maps of the DEM derived filter values to extract potential sites of recent landslide activity. In addition, the relationships between the filter values of deep-seated landslides at various stages of evolution within the field mapped area were extended to the entire study area, to assess the contribution that landslide evolution makes to change in the landscape as a whole. While landslide components made up the steepest as well as the gentlest parts of the landscape depending on their evolutionary stage, landslides were constantly coarsened and steepened by progressive erosion, probably initiated by river bank erosion at the foot of slopes.},

  abstract = {Occurrence of mixed pixels in remote sensing images is a major problem particularly at coarse spatial resolutions. Therefore, sub-pixel classification is often preferred, where a pixel is resolved into various class components (also called class proportions or fractions). While, under most circumstances, land cover information in this form is more effective than crisp classification, sub-pixel classification fails to account for the spatial distribution of class proportions within the pixel. An alternative approach is to consider the spatial distribution of class proportions within and between pixels to perform super-resolution mapping (i.e. mapping land cover at a spatial resolution finer than the size of the pixel of the image). Markov random field (MRF) models are well suited to represent the spatial dependence within and between pixels. In this paper, an MRF model based approach is introduced to generate super-resolution land cover maps from remote sensing data. In the proposed MRF model based approach, the intensity values of pixels in a particular spatial structure (i.e., neighborhood) are allowed to have higher probability (i.e., weight) than others. Remote sensing images at two markedly different spatial resolutions, IKONOS MSS image at 4 m spatial resolution and Landsat ETM+ image at 30 m spatial resolution, are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed MRF model based approach for super-resolution land cover mapping. The results show a significant increase in the accuracy of land cover maps at fine spatial resolution over that obtained from a recently proposed linear optimization approach suggested by Verhoeye and Wulf (2002) (Verhoeye, J., Wulf, R. D. (2002). Land Cover Mapping at Sub-pixel Scales using Linear Optimization Techniques. Remote Sensing of Environment, 79, 96-104). ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Daily distribution of the aerosol optical thickness and columnar mass concentration will be derived over the continents, from the EOS moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) using dark land targets. Dark land covers are mainly vegetated areas and dark soils observed in the red and blue channels; therefore the method will be limited to the moist parts of the continents (excluding water and ice cover). After the launch of MODIS the distribution of elevated aerosol concentrations, for example, biomass burning in the tropics or urban industrial aerosol in the midlatitudes, will be continuously monitored. The algorithm takes advantage of the MODIS wide spectral range and high spatial resolution and the strong spectral dependence of the aerosol opacity for most aerosol types that result in low optical thickness in the mid-IR (2.1 and 3.8 mu m). The main steps of the algorithm are (1) identification of dark pixels in the mid-IR; (2) estimation of their reflectance at 0.47 and 0.66 mu m; and (3) derivation of the optical thickness and mass concentration of the accumulation mode from the detected radiance. To differentiate between dust and aerosol dominated by accumulation mode particles, for example, smoke or sulfates, ratios of the aerosol path radiance at 0.47 and 0.66 mu m are used. New dynamic aerosol models for biomass burning aerosol, dust and aerosol from industrial/urban origin, are used to determine the aerosol optical properties used in the algorithm. The error in the retrieved aerosol optical thicknesses, tau(a), is expected to be Delta tau(a) = 0.05 +/- 0.2 tau(a). Daily values are stored on a resolution of 10 x 10 pixels (1 km nadir resolution). Weighted and gridded 8-day and monthly composites of the optical thickness, the aerosol mass concentration and spectral radiative forcing are generated for selected scattering angles to increase the accuracy. The daily aerosol information over land and oceans [Tanre et al., this issue], combined with continuous aerosol remote sensing from the ground, will be used to study aerosol climatology, to monitor the sources and sinks of specific aerosol types, and to study the interaction of aerosol with water vapor and clouds and their radiative forcing of climate. The aerosol information will also be used for atmospheric corrections of remotely sensed surface reflectance. In this paper, examples of applications and validations are provided.},

  abstract = {Extraction of man-made structures from satellite images is one of the essential issues in remote sensing and many techniques were proposed for building extraction from high resolution satellite images. However, most of them rely stereo analysis or additional data sources such as LIDAR for retrieval of 3D building information. This paper proposes a semiautomatic approach that extracts 3D building information from single satellite images. In this approach, after measuring boundaries of a building roof we determine the building height by projecting building shadow onto the image space until the projected shadow matches the actual shadow. Then we extract building footprints by translating roof boundaries along the direction of vertical edges to the amount determined by the building height. To increase the level of automation, we devised a technique that adjusts the height so that the projected shadow matches the actual shadow and determine building height automatically. We also devised a technique to extract roof boundaries by clicking only two corner points. A panchromatic IKONOS image and Quickbird image over Deajeon area were used to test proposed algorithms and a IKONO stereo pair was used to get reference building heights. While building heights determined manually showed the accuracy of an RMS error of 1.66 m, the heights determined automatically showed an RMS error of 1.86 m. The results show that 3D building information can be extracted from single satellite images and that the automation approaches proposed in this paper worked.},

  abstract = {Near-surface air temperature (T a) is an important variable for various scientific communities, and many previous studies have attempted to estimate T a with high spatial resolution using remotely sensed data. The present study proposes a new, practical method for estimating T a near the land surface based on moisture conditions of the atmosphere and surface. First, match-up data sets of ground observations from 76 meteorological stations and satellite remote-sensing observations were established over the Republic of Korea during 2006. Four cases of atmospheric and surface moisture conditions were then determined using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer brightness temperatures (at 11 and 12 ?m) and the normalized difference water index for all match-ups. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis for each case, land surface temperature and the normalized difference vegetation index were statistically selected as significant independent variables for estimating T a using the development data set (75\% of the match-ups for each case). The T a values estimated from the multiple regression algorithm with different constants and coefficients for each case showed reasonably good performance (nearly zero mean bias and approximately 3°C root mean square error) compared with the measured T a values used as the validation data set (25\% of the match-ups for each case). Thus, the proposed T a estimation approach based on moisture conditions of the atmosphere and surface is not confined to a specific season or land type and can be applied to all areas and seasons in the Republic of Korea.},

  abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is a key indicator of air pollution brought into the air by a variety of natural and human activities. As it can be suspended over long time and travel over long distances in the atmosphere, it can cause a wide range of diseases that lead to a significant reduction of human life. The size of particles has been directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Small particles of concern include "inhalable coarse particles" with a diameter of 2.5 to 10. 𝜇m and "fine particles" smaller than 2.5. 𝜇m in diameter. As the source-effect relationship of PM remains unclear, it is not easy to define such effects from individual sources such as long-range transport of pollution. Because of the potent role of PM and its associated pollutants, detailed knowledge of their human health impacts is of primary importance. This paper summarizes the basic evidence on the health effects of particulate matter. An in-depth analysis is provided to address the implications for policy-makers so that more stringent strategies can be implemented to reduce air pollution and its health effects.},

The focus of this paper is on building-related methods. The paper also describes two recent improvements to the HAZUS Earthquake technology: (1) the Advanced Engineering Building Module (AEBM) and (2) use of ShakeMap ground motion data. The AEBM allows expert users to develop “building-specific” damage and loss functions. ShakeMap ground motion data HAZUS may be used to rapidly assess potential damage and loss immediately following an earthquake. The paper closes with a comparison of damage and loss estimated using ShakeMap data with actual damage and loss due to the 1994 Northridge earthquake.}

In two successive semesters, we presented the same course syllabus using different teaching styles: in fall 2003, the traditional lecture format; and in spring 2004, decreased lecturing and addition of student participation and cooperative problem solving during class time, including frequent in-class assessment of understanding. We used performance on pretests and posttests, and on homework problems to estimate and compare student learning gains between the two semesters. Our results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the more interactive course. To assess reproducibility of these effects, we repeated the interactive course in spring 2005 with similar results. Our findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other disciplines. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a general model for teaching large biology courses that incorporates interactive engagement and cooperative work in place of some lecturing, while retaining course content by demanding greater student responsibility for learning outside of class.},

This thermal contrast is brought about by anthropogenic modification of the environment. For example, there is little bare earth and vegetation in urban areas. This means that less energy is used in evaporating water, less of the Sun's energy is reflected and more heat is stored by buildings and the ground in urban than in rural areas. The heat generated by heating, cooling systems, transport and other energy uses also contributes, particularly in winter, as does the complex three-dimensional structure of the urban landscape which can reduce air flow.},

  abstract = {Satellite imagery is the major data source for regional to global land cover maps. However, land cover mapping of large areas with medium-resolution imagery is costly and often constrained by the lack of good training and validation data. Our goal was to overcome these limitations, and to test chain classifications, i.e., the classification of Landsat images based on the information in the overlapping areas of neighboring scenes. The basic idea was to classify one Landsat scene first where good ground truth data is available, and then to classify the neighboring Landsat scene using the land cover classification of the first scene in the overlap area as training data. We tested chain classification for a forest/non-forest classification in the Carpathian Mountains on one horizontal chain of six Landsat scenes, and two vertical chains of two Landsat scenes each. We collected extensive training data from Quickbird imagery for classifying radiometrically uncorrected data with Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The SVMs classified 8 scenes with overall accuracies between 92.1\% and 98.9\% (average of 96.3\%). Accuracy loss when automatically classifying neighboring scenes with chain classification was 1.9\% on average. Even a chain of six images resulted only in an accuracy loss of 5.1\% for the last image compared to a reference classification from independent training data for the last image. Chain classification thus performed well, but we note that chain classification can only be applied when land cover classes are well represented in the overlap area of neighboring Landsat scenes. As long as this constraint is met though, chain classification is a powerful approach for large area land cover classifications, especially in areas of varying training data availability. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {We present a new algorithm for digital terrain model (DTM) generation from an airborne laser scanning point cloud, called repetitive interpolation (REIN). It is especially applicable in steep, forested areas where other filtering algorithms typically have problems distinguishing between ground returns and off-ground points reflected in the vegetation. REIN can produce a DTM either in a vector grid or in a TIN data structure. REIN is applied after an initial filtering, which involves removal of all negative outliers and removal of many, but not necessarily all, off-ground points by some existing filtering algorithm. REIN makes use of the redundancy in the initially filtered point cloud (FPC) in order to mitigate the effect of the residual off-ground points. Multiple independent random samples are taken from the initial FPC. From each sample, ground elevation estimates are interpolated at individual DTM locations. Because the lower bounds of the distributions of the elevation estimates at each DTM location are almost insensitive to positive outliers, the true ground elevations can be approximated by adding the global mean offset to the lower bounds, which is estimated from the data. The random sampling makes REIN unique among the methods of filtering airborne laser data. While other filters behave deterministically, always generating a filter error in special situations, in REIN, because of its random aspects, these errors do not occur in each sample, and typically cancel out in the final computation of DTM elevations. Reduction of processing time by parallelization of REIN is possible. REIN was tested in a test area of 2 hectares, encompassing steep relief covered by mixed forest. An Optech ALTM 1020 lidar was used, with a flying height of 260–300 m above the ground, the beam divergence was 0.3 mrad, and the obtained point cloud density for the last returns was 8.5 m− 2. A DTM grid was generated with 1 m horizontal resolution. The root mean square elevation error of the DTM ranged between ± 0.16 m and ± 0.37 m, depending on REIN sampling rate and number of samples taken, the lowest value achieved with 4 samples and using a 23\% sampling rate. The paper also gives a short overview on existing filtering algorithms.},

  abstract = {Forest fire management practices are highly dependent on the proper monitoring of the spatial distribution of the natural and man-made fuel complexes at landscape level. Spatial patterns of fuel types as well as the three-dimensional structure and state of the vegetation are essential for the assessment and prediction of forest fire risk and fire behaviour. A combination of the two remote sensing systems, imaging spectrometry and light detection and ranging (LiDAR), is well suited to map fuel types and properties, especially within the complex wildland–urban interface. LiDAR observations sample the spatial information dimension providing explicit geometric information about the structure of the Earth's surface and super-imposed objects. Imaging spectrometry on the other hand samples the spectral dimension, which is sensitive for discrimination of surface types. As a non-parametric classifier support vector machines (SVM) are particularly well adapted to classify data of high dimensionality and from multiple sources as proposed in this work. The presented approach achieves an improved land cover mapping adapted to forest fire management needs. The map is based on a single SVM classifier combining the spectral and spatial information dimensions provided by imaging spectrometry and LiDAR.},

On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5\% and 17.0\% which is considerably better than the previous state of the art. The neural network, which has 60 million paramters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolutional operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers, we employed a recently-developed method called 'dropout' that proved to be effective. We also entered a variant of the model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achievd a top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

In two articles we explore some of the technical issues involved and make practical suggestions about how best to use existing data. We have selected examples to illustrate a range of methodological issues covering specific sectors (hospital, primary care, community care), multiple sectors, individual conditions, multiple conditions, patients, and whole populations. This, the first, article covers indicators more directly related to clinical care—that is, hospital case fatality, hospital admissions for conditions treatable in primary care, cancer survival, and stroke. Our second article covers developmental approaches for mental health, potentially avoidable deaths, and forecasting coronary heart disease outcomes.7 Many other indicators could be produced along similar lines.8},

  abstract = {Information on land cover distribution at regional and global scales has become fundamental for studying global changes affecting ecological and climatic systems. The remote sensing community has responded to this increased interest by improving data quality and methodologies for extracting land cover information. However, in addition to the advantages provided by satellite products, certain limitations exist that need to be objectively quantified and clearly communicated to users so that they can make informed decisions on whether and how land cover products should be used. Accuracy assessment is the procedure used to quantify product quality. Some aspects of accuracy assessment for evaluating four global land cover maps over Canada are discussed in this paper. Attempts are made to quantify limiting factors resulting from the coarse spatial resolution of data used for generating land cover information at regional and global levels. Sub-pixel fractional error matrices are introduced as a more appropriate way for assessing the accuracy of mixed pixels. For classification with coarse spatial resolution data, limitations of the classification method produce a maximum achievable accuracy defined as the average percent fraction of dominant land cover of all pixels in the mapped area. Relationships among spatial resolution, landscape heterogeneity and thematic resolution were studied and reported. Other factors that can affect accuracy, such as misregistration and legend conversion, are also discussed. ?? 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Future anthropogenic climate change is likely to increase the air temperature (T a ) across Europe and increase the frequency, duration and magnitude of severe heat stress events. Heat stress events are generally associated with clear-sky conditions and high T a , which give rise to high radiant heat load, i.e. mean radiant temperature (T mrt ). In urban environments, T mrt is strongly influenced by urban geometry. The present study examines the effect of urban geometry on daytime heat stress in three European cities (Gothenburg in Sweden, Frankfurt in Germany and Porto in Portugal) under present and future climates, using T mrt as an indicator of heat stress. It is found that severe heat stress occurs in all three cities. Similar maximum daytime T mrt is found in open areas in all three cities despite of the latitudinal differences in average daytime T mrt . In contrast, dense urban structures like narrow street canyons are able to mitigate heat stress in the summer, without causing substantial changes in T mrt in the winter. Although the T mrt averages are similar for the north-south and east-west street canyons in each city, the number of hours when T mrt exceeds the threshold values of 55.5 and 59.4 °C-used as indicators of moderate and severe heat stress-in the north-south canyons is much higher than that in the east-west canyons. Using statistically downscaled data from a regional climate model, it is found that the study sites were generally warmer in the future scenario, especially Porto, which would further exacerbate heat stress in urban areas. However, a decrease in solar radiation in Gothenburg and Frankfurt reduces T mrt in the spring, while the reduction in T mrt is somewhat offset by increasing T a in other seasons. It suggests that changes in the T mrt under the future scenario are dominated by variations in T a . Nonetheless, the intra-urban differences remain relatively stable in the future. These findings suggest that dense urban structure can reduce daytime heat stress since it reduces the number of hours of high T mrt in the summer and does not cause substantial changes in average and minimum T mrt in the winter. In dense urban settings, a more diverse urban thermal environment is also preferred to compensate for reduced solar access in the winter. The extent to which the urban geometry can be optimized for the future climate is also influenced by local urban characteristics.},

Street canyons are sheltered from incoming direct solar radiation by shading of buildings while open areas are exposed to intense solar radiation, especially along the sunlit walls where high Tmrtis observed due to reflected short-wave radiation and long-wave radiation emitted from the sunlit building walls. The present study confirms that there are great potential in using urban geometry to mitigate high radiant heat load and daytime heat stress in the compacted urban environment. In high-density subtropical cities where high daytime Tmrtcauses severe thermal discomfort in summer, dense urban structures are able to mitigate the extremely high Tmrtand improve outdoor thermal comfort.

Low resolution data from MODIS sensor with high revisiting time have been used to analyze the daily variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST), the derived Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Medium resolution data from ASTER and LANDSAT 7 sensors have been used for spot assessment of the above mentioned parameters at district level. With medium resolution satellites, LST and NDVI have been analyzed in correspondence of different level of Impervious Surface Areas (ISAs) over the study period.With both datasets, the obtained results showed an inversion of the standard SUHI phenomenon during daytime, where the downtown areas appear colder compared to the suburbs. Throughout the study period, the trend has been replicated and seasonality is also observed, where the inversion of SUHI is accentuated mainly in the summer months with a daily difference of 5-6. K compared to 2-3. K during the winter season, while the standard SUHI can be observed during the night with values of downtown 2-3. K higher than the suburbs. Spot analysis of single images confirmed this trend, adding the contribution of ISA to an average increment of 1. K during winter and 2. K during the summer. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

During the last decade this research has unpacked the complex relationship between writing and learning, and pointed to gaps in students' and tutors' understanding of what is involved in writing for assessment. The article takes this as its starting point but suggests that the focus on particular groups of students and on student writing alone might mask the relevance of the research findings for teaching and learning in higher education more generally. In addition, the increasing use of information and communication technologies and virtual learning environments add dimensions which are only beginning to be recognized in the academic literacies literature. The article uses a specific case study of an online, postgraduate course to explicate some principles of course design, derived from academic literacies research, which take account of the different texts involved in student learning, and do not focus merely on assessed writing. This case study also pays some attention to the ways in which the use of new technologies can be used to the advantage of course designers adopting these principles.},

The sFMS is the spatial engine that has been used to implement both of Canada's national forest fire management information systems, the Canadian wildland fire information system (CWFIS) and the fire monitoring, mapping and modeling system (Fire M3). The CWFIS is Canada's national fire management information system; it presents daily information on fire weather, fire behavior potential and selected upper atmospheric conditions. Fire M3 integrates the use of satellite technology for monitoring and mapping large fire occurrence in Canada. Fire M3 also incorporates information from CWFIS to model the impacts of large forest fires based on fire weather conditions and potential fire behavior.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

This paper concentrates on exploring the concepts of human vulnerability and the methodology of analyzing human vulnerability to chemical accidents in the vicinity of chemical industry parks. A conceptual model of human vulnerability to chemical accidents is developed, revealing the roots of human vulnerability and emphasizing its role in risk management. A geographical information system (GIS)-based methodology for mapping vulnerability is proposed and applied to the Nanjing Chemical Industry Park in China. By combining physical vulnerability and social vulnerability spatially, the total vulnerability is revealed to better respond to accidents. It is proposed to improve traffic lines and allocation of medical services, and include vulnerability assessment in land-use planning to reduce future risks. In other words, it seems feasible and effective to reveal physical, social and total vulnerability of residents in the vicinity of chemical risk sources.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is taking place at an unprecedented rate around the world, particularly in China in the past few decades. One of the key impacts of rapid urbanization on the environment is the effect of urban heat island (UHI). Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on UHI is crucial for improving the ecology and sustainability of cities. This study investigated how landscape composition and configuration would affect UHI in the Shanghai metropolitan region of China, based on the analysis of land surface temperature (LST) in relation to normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), vegetation fraction (Fv), and percent impervious surface area (ISA). Two Landsat ETM+ images acquired on March 13 and July 2, 2001 were used to estimate LST, Fv, and percent ISA. Landscape metrics were calculated from a high spatial resolution (2.5 ?? 2.5. m) land-cover/land-use map. Our results have showed that, although there are significant variations in LST at a given fraction of vegetation or impervious surface on a per-pixel basis, NDVI, Fv, and percent ISA are all good predictors of LST on the regional scale. There is a strong negative linear relationship between LST and positive NDVI over the region. Similar but stronger negative linear relationship exists between LST and Fv. Urban vegetation could mitigate the surface UHI better in summer than in early spring. A strong positive relationship exists between mean LST and percent ISA. The residential land is the biggest contributor to UHI, followed by industrial land. Although industrial land has the highest LST, it has limited contribution to the overall surface UHI due to its small spatial extend in Shanghai. Among the residential land-uses, areas with low- to-middle-rise buildings and low vegetation cover have much high temperatures than areas with high-rise buildings or areas with high vegetation cover. A strong correlation between the mean LST and landscape metrics indicates that urban landscape configuration also influences the surface UHI. These findings are helpful for understanding urban ecology as well as land use planning to minimize the potential environmental impacts of urbanization. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM) has generated one of the most complete high-resolution digital topographic data sets of the world to date. The ASTER GDEM covers land surfaces between 83° N and 83° S at a spatial resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately 30 m at the equator). As an improvement over Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) coverage, the ASTER GDEM will be a very useful product for many applications, such as relief analysis, hydrological studies, and radar interferometry. In this article, its absolute vertical accuracy in China was assessed at five study sites using ground control points (GCPs) from high-accuracy GPS benchmarks and also using a DEM-to-DEM comparison with the Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research Consortium for Spatial Information (CGIAR-CSI) SRTM DEM Version 4.1. It is demonstrated that the vertical accuracy of ASTER GDEM is 26 m (root mean square error (RMSE)) against GPS-GCPs, while for the SRTM DEM it is 23 m. Furthermore, height differences in the GDEM-SRTM comparison appear to be overestimated in the areas with a south or southwest aspect in the five study areas. To a certain extent, the error can be attributed to variations in heights due to land-cover effects and undefined inland waterbodies. But the ASTER GDEM needs further error-mitigating improvements to meet the expected accuracy specification. However, as for its unprecedented detail, it is believed that the ASTER GDEM offers a major alternative in accessibility to high-quality elevation data.}

The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from space. However, retrieving LST is still a challenging task since the LST retrieval problem is ill-posed. This paper reviews the current status of selected remote sensing algorithms for estimating LST from thermal infrared (TIR) data. A brief theoretical background of the subject is presented along with a survey of the algorithms employed for obtaining LST from space-based TIR measurements. The discussion focuses on TIR data acquired from polar-orbiting satellites because of their widespread use, global applicability and higher spatial resolution compared to geostationary satellites. The theoretical framework and methodologies used to derive the LST from the data are reviewed followed by the methodologies for validating satellite-derived LST. Directions for future research to improve the accuracy of satellite-derived LST are then suggested. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this research, with the same Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data set and the same classification scheme over Guangzhou City, China, we tested two unsupervised and 13 supervised classification algorithms, including a number of machine learning algorithms that became popular in remote sensing during the past 20 years. Our analysis focused primarily on the spectral information provided by the TM data. We assessed all algorithms in a per-pixel classification decision experiment and all supervised algorithms in a segment-based experiment. We found that when sufficiently representative training samples were used, most algorithms performed reasonably well. Lack of training samples led to greater classification accuracy discrepancies than classification algorithms themselves. Some algorithms were more tolerable to insufficient (less representative) training samples than others. Many algorithms improved the overall accuracy marginally with per-segment decision making.},

It employs 1 m National Agricultural Imagery Program data of land-cover with 120 m Landsat-derived land surface temperature, decomposed to 30. m, a new measure of configuration, the normalized moment of inertia, and U.S. Census data to address the question for two randomly selected samples comprising 523 and 545 residential neighborhoods (census blocks) in the city. The results indicate that, contrary to most other studies, land configuration has a stronger influence on LST than land composition. In addition, both land configuration and architecture combined with cadastral, demographic, and economic variables, capture a significant amount of explained variance in LST. The results indicate that attention to land architecture in the development of or reshaping of neighborhoods may ameliorate the summer extremes in LST.},

To date, insufficient attention has been given to the many error sources contributing to the uncertainty of scanner datasets. A full error budget for directly georeferenced terrestrial laser scanner networks that considers both relevant error sources fundamental to surveying and those unique to sampled laser scanner systems is derived. In the case of the latter, new probabilistic models are proposed for angular positional uncertainty due to laser beamwidth and centroid-based target pointing. Analysis of a cultural heritage-recording project in Ayutthaya, Thailand, highlights the disparity between “expected” precision and the more realistic precision indicated by the error budget and demonstrates that the beamwidth error can be a significant factor. The causes and effects of several systematic errors inherent to TLS datasets are also discussed.}

The algorithm exploits the four-channel (blue, green, red and near infrared) multispectral imaging capability of some terrestrial scanners using supervised, parametric classification to assign thematic class labels to all scan cloud points. Its principal advantage is that it is a completely data-driven algorithm and is independent of spatial sampling resolution since the processing is performed in four-dimensional spectral feature space. Its application to two data-sets of different spatial extent and spatial and spectral complexity is reported, for which respective overall classification accuracies of 87˙0\% and 82˙0\% were achieved. Analysis of the input data with emphasis on the characteristics pertinent to the anticipated outcomes precedes detailed analysis of the classification results and error sources and their causes. Erroneously classified points are attributed to radiometric errors stemming from both detector hardware and physical effects.},

  abstract = {The extent of the surface area sunlit is critical for radiative energy exchanges and therefore for a wide range of applications that require urban land surface models (ULSM), ranging from human comfort to weather forecasting. Here a computationally demanding shadow casting algorithm is used to assess the capability of a simple single-layer urban canopy model, which assumes an infinitely long rotating canyon (ILC), to reproduce sunlit areas on roofs, walls and roads over central London. Results indicate that the sunlit road areas are well-represented but somewhat smaller using an ILC, while sunlit roofs areas are consistently larger, especially for dense urban areas. The largest deviations from real world sunlit areas are for roofs during mornings and evenings. Sunlit fractions on walls are overestimated using an ILC during mornings and evenings are found. The implications of these errors are dependent on the application targeted. For example, (independent of albedo) ULSMs used in numerical weather prediction applying ILC representation of the urban form will overestimate outgoing shortwave radiation from roofs due to the overestimation of sunlit fraction of the roofs. Complications of deriving height to width ratios from real world data are also discussed.},

  abstract = {The extent of the surface area sunlit is critical for radiative energy exchanges and therefore for a wide range of applications that require urban land surface models (ULSM), ranging from human comfort to weather forecasting. Here a computationally demanding shadow casting algorithm is used to assess the capability of a simple single-layer urban canopy model, which assumes an infinitely long rotating canyon (ILC), to reproduce sunlit areas on roofs, walls and roads over central London. Results indicate that the sunlit road areas are well-represented but somewhat smaller using an ILC, while sunlit roofs areas are consistently larger, especially for dense urban areas. The largest deviations from real world sunlit areas are for roofs during mornings and evenings. Sunlit fractions on walls are overestimated using an ILC during mornings and evenings are found. The implications of these errors are dependent on the application targeted. For example, (independent of albedo) ULSMs used in numerical weather prediction applying ILC representation of the urban form will overestimate outgoing shortwave radiation from roofs due to the overestimation of sunlit fraction of the roofs. Complications of deriving height to width ratios from real world data are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Airborne LiDAR is one of the most effective and reliable means of terrain data collection. Using LiDAR data for digital elevation model (DEM) generation is becoming a standard practice in spatial related areas. However, the effective processing of the raw LiDAR data and the generation of an efficient and high-quality DEM remain big challenges. This paper reviews the recent advances of airborne LiDAR systems and the use of LiDAR data for DEM generation, with special focus on LiDAR data filters, interpolation methods, DEM resolution, and LiDAR data reduction. Separating LiDAR points into ground and non-ground is the most critical and difficult step for DEM generation from LiDAR data. Commonly used and most recently developed LiDAR filtering methods are presented. Interpolation methods and choices of suitable interpolator and DEM resolution for LiDAR DEM generation are discussed in detail. In order to reduce the data redundancy and increase the efficiency in terms of storage and manipulation, LiDAR data reduction is required in the process of DEM generation. Feature specific elements such as breaklines contribute significantly to DEM quality. Therefore, data reduction should be conducted in such a way that critical elements are kept while less important elements are removed. Given the high-density characteristic of LiDAR data, breaklines can be directly extracted from LiDAR data. Extraction of breaklines and integration of the breaklines into DEM generation are presented.},

Two algorithms were applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) distribution from the Landsat TM and ASTER data. The spatial pattern of LST in the study area is retrieved to characterize their local effects on urban heat island. In addition, the correlation between LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) is analyzed to explore the impacts of the green land and the build-up land on the urban heat island by calculating the ecological evaluation index of sub-urban areas. The results indicate that the effect of urban heat island in Hong Kong is mainly located in three sub-urban areas, namely, Kowloon Island, the northern Hong Kong Island and Hong Kong International Airport. The correlation between LST and NDVI, NDBI also indicates that the negative correlation of LST and NDVI suggests that the green land can weaken the effect on urban heat island, while the positive correlation between LST and NDBI means that the built-up land can strengthen the effect of urban heat island in our case study. Although satellite data (e.g., Landsat TM and ASTER thermal bands data) can be applied to examine the distribution of urban heat islands in places such as Hong Kong, the method still needs to be refined with in situ measurements of LST in future studies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a method to optimise the calibration of parameters and land use transition rules of a cellular automata (CA) urban growth model using a self-adaptive genetic algorithm (SAGA). Optimal calibration is achieved through an algorithm that minimises the difference between the simulated and observed urban growth. The model was applied to simulate land use change from non-urban to urban in South East Queensland's Logan City, Australia, from 1991 to 2001. The performance of the calibrated model was evaluated by comparing the empirical land use change maps from the Landsat imagery to the simulated land use change produced by the calibrated model. The simulation accuracies of the model show that the calibrated model generated 86.3\% correctness, mostly due to observed persistence being simulated as persistence and some due to observed change being simulated as change. The 13.7\% simulation error was due to nearly equal amounts of observed persistence being simulated as change (7.5\%) and observed change being simulated as persistence (6.2\%). Both the SAGA-CA model and a logistic-based CA model without SAGA optimisation have simulated more change than the amount of observed change over the simulation period; however, the overestimation is slightly more severe for the logistic-CA model. The SAGA-CA model also outperforms the logistic-CA model with fewer quantity and allocation errors and slightly more hits. For Logan City, the most important factors driving urban growth are the spatial proximity to existing urban centres, roads and railway stations. However, the probability of a place being urbanised is lower when people are attracted to work in other regions.},

The results suggest that all three improvements have merit. The paper further explores the effect of using log-ratios rather than percentages (minimal) and of local rather than global measures of segregation (which allows for considerably greater insight into population characteristics).

An assessment of these impacts was made that considered the annual impact of the UHI, not just the summer impact. It was found that in north of the US there was a net decrease in energy use from the UHI, as heating energy reductions were larger than the increase in cooling energy. In the south there was a net energy increase from the UHI. The impact of the UHI on heat related deaths was an estimated increase of 1.1 deaths per million people. The impact of the UHI on cold related deaths was an estimated decrease of 4.0 deaths per million people. These estimates are caveated by the acknowledgement that compounding factors influence mortality. Hypothermia related death rates were three times higher in rural areas than urban areas. This is surprising as the homeless population is usually considered the most at risk, yet they mostly live in urban areas.},

Effectiveness of impervious surface in urban land-use classification has not been well addressed. This paper explored extraction of impervious surface information from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data based on the integration of fraction images from linear spectral mixture analysis and land surface temperature. A new approach for urban land-use classification, based on the combined use of impervious surface and population density, was developed. Five urban land-use classes (i.e., low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-intensity residential areas, and commercial/industrial/transportation uses) were developed in the city of Indianapolis, Indiana, USA. Results showed that the integration of fraction images and surface temperature provided substantially improved impervious surface image. Accuracy assessment indicated that the root-mean-square error and system error yielded 9.22\% and 5.68\%, respectively, for the impervious surface image. The overall classification accuracy of 83.78\% for five urban land-use classes was obtained. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Mapping and monitoring impervious surface dynamic change in a complex urban-rural frontier with medium or coarse spatial resolution images is a challenge due to the mixed pixel problem and the spectral confusion between impervious surfaces and other non-vegetation land covers. This research selected Lucas do Rio Verde County in Mato Grosso State, Brazil as a case study to improve impervious surface estimation performance by the integrated use of Landsat and QuickBird images and to monitor impervious surface change by analyzing the normalized multitemporal Landsat-derived fractional impervious surfaces. This research demonstrates the importance of two step calibrations. The first step is to calibrate the Landsat-derived fraction impervious surface values through the established regression model based on the QuickBird-derived impervious surface image in 2008. The second step is to conduct the normalization between the calibrated 2008 impervious surface image with other dates of impervious surface images. This research indicates that the per-pixel based method overestimates the impervious surface area in the urban-rural frontier by 50-60\%. In order to accurately estimate impervious surface area, it is necessary to map the fractional impervious surface image and further calibrate the estimates with high spatial resolution images. Also normalization of the multitemporal fractional impervious surface images is needed to reduce the impacts from different environmental conditions, in order to effectively detect the impervious surface dynamic change in a complex urban-rural frontier. The procedure developed in this paper for mapping and monitoring impervious surface area is especially valuable in urban-rural frontiers where multitemporal Landsat images are difficult to be used for accurately extracting impervious surface features based on traditional per-pixel based classification methods as they cannot effectively handle the mixed pixel problem.},

  abstract = {To increase understanding of forest carbon cycles and stocks, estimates of total and component (e.g. leaf, branch and trunk) biomass at a range of scales are desirable. Focusing on mixed species forests in central south‐east Queensland, two different approaches to the retrieval of biomass from small footprint Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) hyperspectral data were developed and compared. In the first, stems were located using a LiDAR crown openness index, and each was associated with crowns delineated and identified to species using CASI data. The component biomass for individual trees was then estimated using LiDAR‐derived height and stem diameter as input to species‐specific allometric equations. When summed to give total above‐ground biomass (AGB) and aggregated to the plot level, these estimates showed a reasonable correspondence with ground (plot‐based) estimates (r 2 = 0.56, RSE = 25.3 Mg ha−1, n = 21) given the complex forest being assessed. In the second approach, a Jackknife linear regression utilizing six LiDAR strata heights and crown cover at the plot‐scale produced more robust estimates of AGB that showed a closer correspondence with plot‐scale ground data (r 2 = 0.90, RSE = 11.8 Mg ha−1, n = 31). AGB aggregated from the tree‐level and Jackknife regression plot‐based AGB estimates (for 270 plots—each of 0.25 ha) compared well for more mature homogeneous and open forests. However, at the tree level, AGB was overestimated in taller forests dominated by trees with large spreading crowns, and underestimated AGB where an understorey with a high density of stems occurred. The study demonstrated options for quantifying component biomass and AGB through integration of LiDAR and CASI data but highlighted the requirement for methods that give improved estimation of tree density (by size class distributions) and species occurrence in complex forests.}

Cloud free imagery was acquired in or close to the month of July coinciding with WA's winter months coinciding with peak green-up facilitating the greatest contrast between spectrally similar surfaces (e.g. bare earth and urban). Imagery was first standardised and normalised to remove inherent residual noise (e.g. differences in modelled atmospheric correction parameters) whilst permitting classification of all imagery based upon a single classification model. The model was computed from the 2005 image representing the month post maximum rainfall of all considered imagery associated with peak greenness and maximum spectral separability. Classification of the normalised data was achieved with the Import Vector Machine (IVM) algorithm following a hybrid forward/backward strategy that adds import vectors whilst continuously testing validity in each step, producing a sparse and more accurate classification solution. Classified land cover data is provided in raster format (.tif) and divided into the classes: bare earth (1), grassland (2), low urban albedo (e.g. asphalt (3)), water (4), forest (5) and high urban albedo (e.g. concrete (6)).

  abstract = {Urban areas are Earth’s fastest growing land use that impact hydrological and ecological systems and the surface energy balance. The identification and extraction of accurate spatial information relating to urban areas is essential for future sustainable city planning owing to its importance within global environmental change and human–environment interactions. However, monitoring urban expansion using medium resolution (30–250 m) imagery remains challenging due to the variety of surface materials that contribute to measured reflectance resulting in spectrally mixed pixels. This research integrates high spatial resolution orthophotos and Landsat imagery to identify differences across a range of diverse urban subsets within the rapidly expanding Perth Metropolitan Region (PMR), Western Australia. Results indicate that calibrating Landsat-derived subpixel land-cover estimates with correction values (calculated from spatially explicit comparisons of subpixel Landsat values to classified high-resolution data which accounts for over [under] estimations of Landsat) reduces moderate resolution urban area over (under) estimates by on an average 55.08\% for the PMR. This approach can be applied to other urban areas globally through use of frequently available and/or low-cost high spatial resolution imagery (e.g. using Google Earth). This will improve urban growth estimations to help monitor and measure change whilst providing metrics to facilitate sustainable urban development targets within cities around the world.},

  abstract = {Earth observation data can provide valuable assessments for monitoring the spatial extent of (un)sustainable urban growth of the world’s cities to better inform planning policy in reducing associated economic, social and environmental costs. Western Australia has witnessed rapid economic expansion since the turn of the century founded upon extensive natural resource extraction. Thus, Perth, the state capital of Western Australia, has encountered significant population and urban growth in response to the booming state economy. However, the recent economic slowdown resulted in the largest decrease in natural resource values that Western Australia has ever experienced. Here, we present multi-temporal urban expansion statistics from 1990 to 2015 for Perth, derived from Landsat imagery. Current urban estimates used for future development plans and progress monitoring of infill and density targets are based upon aggregated census data and metrics unrepresentative of actual land cover change, underestimating overall urban area. Earth observation provides a temporally consistent methodology, identifying areal urban area at higher spatial and temporal resolution than current estimates. Our results indicate that the spatial extent of the Perth Metropolitan Region has increased 45\% between 1990 and 2015, over 320 km2. We highlight the applicability of earth observation data in accurately quantifying urban area for sustainable targeted planning practices.},

  abstract = {Emissivity and surface temperature enables better understanding of the overall urban land use/land cover classes and in turn helps in understanding the energy budget issues. In the present study it has been demonstrated that the notion of the assumed spectral emissivity (i.e. 1) induces errors in modeling the surface energy budget and urban climatology (micro-climate), especially over heterogeneous surface areas (urban) where emissivity is far smaller than unity. An attempt has been made to derive emissivity by using normalized difference moisture index (NDMI). The emissivity per pixel has been retrieved directly from satellite data and has been estimated as narrow band emissivity at the satellite sensor channel in order to have least error in the surface temperature estimation. The estimated emissivity values over few land use/land cover (LULC) classes of LANDSAT TM have been compared with the literature values and field measurement emissivity data using infrared thermometer. A strong correlation is observed between surface temperatures with NDMI over different LULC classes. A regression relation between these parameters has been estimated (Pearson's correlation of 0.938), indicating that surface temperatures can be predicted if NDMI values are known. The error in field data (in situ) and satellite derived surface temperature is within the range of 2-3 °C. The correlation coefficient between the satellite derived and field observed surface temperature is very high ≈0.942 (significant at p value = 0.01). The results suggest that the methodology is feasible to estimate NDMI, surface emissivity and surface temperature with reasonable accuracy over heterogeneous urban areas.

It is increasingly recognized that community responses and adaptation strategies are essential for planning future mitigation action. In order to investigate the community responses and adaptation strategies employed in Jakarta, in-depth interviews were performed in the flood-prone areas. The results reveal that vulnerability to flooding is increasing, and it is linked to several factors: (1) stakeholders, (2) environment, (3) communities, and (4) infrastructure and its maintenance. Various physical adaptation strategies have been adopted by the local communities, which include raising the housing level, building terraced housing, and building small dikes to prevent water entering the settlements. Several non-physical adaptations were also identified from the fieldwork. These adaptations tend to be conducted through communal work and the reuse of resources and materials left undamaged by flooding. However, uncoordinated responses during flood events produce greater exposure to the hazard, and it can be inferred that community responses remain below the ideal. This study highlights the need for urgent attention to be given to improving the institutional links between stakeholders, especially at the municipal level, which could provide more efficient disaster response.},

Various definitions of interactivity exist in the literature, alternately focusing on the participants, structure and technology. The PLS TXT UR Thoughts research project builds on existing definitions to define interactivity as a message loop originating from and concluding with the student. The authors chose to introduce mobile phones and short message service (SMS) within the classroom due to the ubiquity of mobile phones among students and the interactive potential of SMS. SMS is a low-threshold application used widely by students to quickly send concise, text-based messages at any time. The research presented involved students sending SMS in real-time, in class, via their personal mobile phones. Using a modem interfacing with customised software to produce SMS files, the lecturer can view the messages and verbally develop the interactive loop with students during class. The SMS are available online after class, allowing interactive loops to further develop via threaded comments. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Most research on the benefits of using clickers in the classroom has shown that students become engaged and enjoy using them. However, research on learning outcomes has only compared the use of clickers to traditional lecture methods. Although learning outcomes are higher when using clickers, the question is whether the clickers or the active learning pedagogies are the cause. For this reason, I conducted a study that compared learning outcomes resulting from the use of clickers versus another active learning method—class discussion. Even though both techniques employ active learning, would using clickers increase learning outcomes more than another active learning approach? Two key features distinguish clicker use: Clickers provide a mechanism for students to participate anonymously. Clickers integrate a "game approach" that may engage students more than traditional class discussion. The study also investigated students' perceptions of their learning using clickers versus classroom discussion.},

This map is based on a NDVI-differencing approach for establishing urban change filtered with a landcover classification to minimize confusion with agriculture. Results show that the built-up area surrounding Washington DC has expanded at a rate of ∼22km2 per year during this period, with notably higher growth during the late-1980s. Comparisons with census data indicate that the physical growth of the urban plan, observable from space, can be reasonably correlated with regional and national economic patterns.},

This problem is further complicated by the non-convexity of regions typically encountered in practice. In this paper a model for maximizing the service coverage of continuously distributed demand through the location of a single service facility in continuous space is proposed. To address this problem, theoretical conditions are established and associated methods are proposed for optimally siting a service facility in a region (convex or non-convex) with uniformly distributed demand. Through the use of geographic information systems (GIS), the developed approach is applied to identify facility sites that maximize regional coverage provided limitations on facility service ability.},

The sustainable management of natural resources has a growing research focus as the awareness of the complexity of interactions between socio-cultural, economical and biophysical system components is increasingly acknowledged. As better data and methods become available, the complexity of the system representation is augmenting. At the same time realism and relevance are increasing and allowing direct support for management and policy development. This article gives the background of recent developments in EDSS and summarises a selected set of papers that were presented at the 2nd Biennial Conference of the International Society of Environmental Modelling and Software (IEMSS 2004). Recent developments show a continuum between integrated assessment modelling and EDSS with varying levels of stakeholder participation in both EDSS development and application. There is a general tendency towards better utilisation of interdisciplinary data, integration and visualisation of temporal and spatial results. Future developments appear directed towards better representation of reality in models, improving user-friendliness and use in a negotiation or group discussion context.},

  abstract = {This work presents an investigation of the forest information content of spectral vegetation indices including the SR, NDVI, PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI. The results were derived from two separate reflectance models including a geometric–optical and a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model, assuming nadir viewing. The effects of the atmosphere on the indices were also examined, using the 6S atmospheric code, and a short section is devoted to an analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper data. Overall, the indices were not linear with respect to forest cover and, in many situations, an index did not have a unique value for a given cover. The general form of the indices' responses to changes in cover could be explained by shadowing effects, linked to the heterogeneous nature of forest. The indices were also significantly affected by perturbations including solar zenith angle, background reflectance, stand structure, and leaf-area index. The relative importance of these perturbations depended on both the cover and on the particular spectral index tested. Existing indices should be selected according to the characteristics of the site under investigation, since no single index performed well over all covers. At low covers, GEMI performed best, where a decrease in the value of GEMI corresponded to an increase in crown cover. There was some evidence that the soil-adjusted indices (PVI, SAVI, TSAVI, and GEMI) partially reduced background reflectance effects in the data, although the reductions were not always associated with increased sensitivity to crown cover. At high covers, SAVI and TSAVI were found to perform best, since these indices had large dynamic ranges and small susceptibility to atmospheric perturbations. Further work is required to develop spectral indices specifically for conifer forests.}

  abstract = {A novel approach is taken to the problem of estimating global water scarcity, using a realistic and consistent procedure applied across many countries. Water demands, surface flows and groundwater availability are estimated on a gridded basis, and various water availability indices are derived comparing the resource with the projected demand. Surface flows are estimated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model linking climate to runoff and, in the major river basins, the runoff estimates for individual grid cells are accumulated to give estimates for the total flows at all points of interest. Groundwater availability is derived from hydrogeological maps based on estimates of the potential yield that can be expected from a borehole and the likely maximum borehole density. Estimates of potential groundwater recharge derived from the surface water model are also taken into account. Water demands are based on current and projected population and livestock numbers, and information on irrigation schemes and industrial water use. Results are presented for the application of the model to a region covering the whole of eastern and southern Africa. The main scenario considered includes the combined impact of climate change, population growth and improved living standards to the year 2050. The results for this scenario show that water scarcity is likely to increase in many countries in the region, with particular problems in the countries around Lake Victoria and in the southernmost parts of the pilot region.},

First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.},

Since urban areas are warmer (i.e., heat island effect) we also tested if cities were inhabited by species from warmer/drier environments. Species richness was lower in industrial areas relative to other urban and natural environments. There are two distinct ant assemblages; 1) areas with thick canopy cover, and 2) more disturbed open urban areas. Native ant assemblages in open environments have more southwestern (i.e., warmer/drier) distributions than forest assemblages. High native species richness suggests that urban environments may allow species to persist that are disappearing from natural habitat fragments. The subset of species adapted to warmer/drier environments indicates that urban areas may facilitate the movement of some species. This suggests that urban adapted ants may be particularly successful at tracking future climate change. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {Community hospital placement is dictated by a diverse set of geographical factors and historical contingency. In the summer of 2004, a multi-organizational committee headed by the State of Michigan's Department of Community Health approached the authors of this paper with questions about how spatial analyses might be employed to develop a revised community hospital approval procedure. Three objectives were set. First, the committee needed visualizations of both the spatial pattern of Michigan's population and its 139 community hospitals. Second, the committee required a clear, defensible assessment methodology to quantify access to existing hospitals statewide, taking into account factors such as distance to nearest hospital and road network density to estimate travel time. Third, the committee wanted to contrast the spatial distribution of existing community hospitals with a theoretical configuration that best met statewide demand. This paper presents our efforts to first describe the distribution of Michigan's current community hospital pattern and its people, and second, develop two models, access-based and demand-based, to identify areas with inadequate access to existing hospitals.

  abstract = {RATIONALE: Episode analyses of heat waves have documented a comparatively higher impact on mortality than on morbidity (hospital admissions) in European cities. The evidence from daily time series studies is scarce and inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the impact of high environmental temperatures on hospital admissions during April to September in 12 European cities participating in the Assessment and Prevention of Acute Health Effects of Weather Conditions in Europe (PHEWE) project. METHODS: For each city, time series analysis was used to model the relationship between maximum apparent temperature (lag 0-3 days) and daily hospital admissions for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and respiratory causes by age (all ages, 65-74 age group, and 75+ age group), and the city-specific estimates were pooled for two geographical groupings of cities. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For respiratory admissions, there was a positive association that was heterogeneous between cities. For a 1 degrees C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a threshold, respiratory admissions increased by +4.5\% (95\% confidence interval, 1.9-7.3) and +3.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 0.8-5.5) in the 75+ age group in Mediterranean and North-Continental cities, respectively. In contrast, the association between temperature and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular admissions tended to be negative and did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: High temperatures have a specific impact on respiratory admissions, particularly in the elderly population, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Why high temperature increases cardiovascular mortality but not cardiovascular admissions is also unclear. The impact of extreme heat events on respiratory admissions is expected to increase in European cities as a result of global warming and progressive population aging.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the impact of urban form and landscaping type on the mid-afternoon microclimate in semi-arid Phoenix, Arizona. The goal is to find effective urban form and design strategies to ameliorate temperatures during the summer months. We simulated near-ground air temperatures for typical residential neighborhoods in Phoenix using the three-dimensional microclimate model ENVI-met. The model was validated using weather observations from the North Desert Village (NDV) landscape experiment, located on the Arizona State University's Polytechnic campus. The NDV is an ideal site to determine the model's input parameters, since it is a controlled environment recreating three prevailing residential landscape types in the Phoenix metropolitan area (mesic, oasis, and xeric). After validation, we designed five neighborhoods with different urban forms that represent a realistic cross-section of typical residential neighborhoods in Phoenix. The scenarios follow the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification scheme after Stewart and Oke. We then combined the neighborhoods with three landscape designs and, using ENVI-met, simulated microclimate conditions for these neighborhoods for a typical summer day. Results were analyzed in terms of mid-afternoon air temperature distribution and variation, ventilation, surface temperatures, and shading. Findings show that advection is important for the distribution of within-design temperatures and that spatial differences in cooling are strongly related to solar radiation and local shading patterns. In mid-afternoon, dense urban forms can create local cool islands. Our approach suggests that the LCZ concept is useful for planning and design purposes. © 2013 The Authors.},

But it has been difficult to separate these two influences because both tend to increase the daily mean surface temperature3, 4. The impact of urbanization has been estimated by comparing observations in cities with those in surrounding rural areas, but the results differ significantly depending on whether population data5 or satellite measurements of night light6, 7, 8 are used to classify urban and rural areas7, 8. Here we use the difference between trends in observed surface temperatures in the continental United States and the corresponding trends in a reconstruction of surface temperatures determined from a reanalysis of global weather over the past 50 years, which is insensitive to surface observations, to estimate the impact of land-use changes on surface warming. Our results suggest that half of the observed decrease in diurnal temperature range is due to urban and other land-use changes. Moreover, our estimate of 0.27 °C mean surface warming per century due to land-use changes is at least twice as high as previous estimates based on urbanization alone7, 8.},

  abstract = {A common-perhaps modal-representation of geography in spatial analysis and geographic information systems is native (unexamined) objects interacting based on simple distance and connectivity relationships within an empty Euclidean space. This is only one possibility among a large set of geographic representations that can support quantitative analysis. Through the vehicle of GIS, many researchers are adopting this representation without realizing its assumptions or its alternatives. Rather than locking researchers into a single representation, GIS could serve as a toolkit for estimating and exploring alternative geographic representations and their analytical possibilities. The article reviews geographic representations, their associated analytical possibilities and relevant computational tools in the combined spatial analysis and GIScience literatures. The discussion identifies several research and development frontiers, including analytical gaps in current GIS software.}

  abstract = {The rapidly expanding urban areas of the world constitute an environmental challenge for the 21st century that requires both new analytic approaches and new sources of data and information. Management of the urban environment must consider phenomena at three scales, including the physical environment within cities, environmental systems consisting of cities and their regional hinterlands, and the environmental implications of the global network of megacities. Increasing availability of remotely sensed observations and a variety of other geospatial information could facilitate the development of new tools and approaches for understanding the urban environment. These new applications should take advantage of the special characteristics of remotely sensed data, including their broad spatial coverage, their capacity for routine and unobtrusive updating and their ability to provide self-consistent measurements of critical physical properties that would be difficult or expensive to obtain in situ. In many cases, using remote sensing data to measure and monitor urban environmental conditions will be more straightforward than using them for urban planning purposes, where traditional sources of governmental and private sector data are more easily obtained and understood. In developing countries, however, remote sensing may provide fundamental observations of urban growth and environmental conditions that are not available from other sources. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Wind energy represents one of the most important renewable resources. Wind energy is a clean, renewable and its benefits are considered greater than the disadvantages. However, even though wind farms represent environmentally friendly projects, they frequently generate public resistance. One of the main disadvantages of wind farm construction projects is their poor aesthetic integration into the landscape. On the other hand, landscape impact of wind farms could be minimised if the visual impact is previously evaluated. As regards with the European legislation, the procedure of environmental impact assessment study is necessary before a wind farm project could be established. In contrast, there is not an objective methodology to assess the visual impact of wind farms. The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to predict and evaluate, before its construction, the visual impact of wind farms, taking into account the visualscape from different observation points. Proposed methodology could help to determine and evaluate the best location for new wind farm projects. Moreover, this method could be used as a consulting tool for public organization and private institutions, being quick, concise and clear.},

  abstract = {While international markets for woody biomass emerge, growing consumption of wood chips for energy in Denmark is leading to increasing import. With improved competitiveness and unquestionable environmental benefits, domestic wood chip supply is preferable, but measures must be taken to make the supply chain more cost efficient. One of the major contributors to the delivered costs of wood chips is transportation, which is highly determined by the geographical location of forests and energy plants. This paper presents a method based on continuous cost surface mapping using raster-based geographical information systems (GISs). The national wood chip resources have been mapped and for selected bioenergy plants the costs of transporting the annual fuel demand have been modelled using cost distance functions, supply curves and sensitivity analysis. Hence a geographically determined relation of cumulative wood chip resources and their average costs was established. The results may be used for socio-economically sound resource allocation, optimal plant fuel mix, and planning of future energy plants.},

  abstract = {In response to the need for a simple atmospheric correction method and the consequent verification of such a method, an experiment was conducted to acquire a data set suitable for testing atmospheric correction procedures under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Several procedures, including radiative transfer codes (RTCs) with simulated atmospheres, image-based procedures and dark-object subtraction (DOS), were evaluated by comparing surface reflectance factors derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital data with low-altitude, aircraft-based measurements for seven dates over a 1-year period. Acceptable results, approximately ± 0.02 reflectance (1 σ RMS), were achieved based on an RTC with appropriate simulated atmospheres. The DOS technique was the least accurate method and, in fact, produced greater error in estimations of near-IR reflectance than no correction at all. Two hybrid approaches, which combined the image-based nature of DOS with the precision of an RTC, provided sufficient accuracy and simplicity to warrant consideration for use on an operational basis. Though these results were probably site-specific (characterized by relatively low aerosol levels and low humidity), they illustrate the feasibility of simple atmospheric correction methods and the usefulness of a diverse data set for validation of such techniques.}

  abstract = {The seasonality of sunlight and rainfall regulates net primary production in tropical forests. Previous studies have suggested that light is more limiting than water for tropical forest productivity, consistent with greening of Amazon forests during the dry season in satellite data. We evaluated four potential mechanisms for the seasonal green-up phenomenon, including increases in leaf area or leaf reflectance, using a sophisticated radiative transfer model and independent satellite observations from lidar and optical sensors. Here we show that the apparent green up of Amazon forests in optical remote sensing data resulted from seasonal changes in near-infrared reflectance, an artefact of variations in sun-sensor geometry. Correcting this bidirectional reflectance effect eliminated seasonal changes in surface reflectance, consistent with independent lidar observations and model simulations with unchanging canopy properties. The stability of Amazon forest structure and reflectance over seasonal timescales challenges the paradigm of light-limited net primary production in Amazon forests and enhanced forest growth during drought conditions. Correcting optical remote sensing data for artefacts of sun-sensor geometry is essential to isolate the response of global vegetation to seasonal and interannual climate variability.},

SVMs are particularly appealing in the remote sensing field due to their ability to generalize well even with limited training samples, a common limitation for remote sensing applications. However, they also suffer from parameter assignment issues that can significantly affect obtained results. A summary of empirical results is provided for various applications of over one hundred published works (as of April, 2010).

Facing accelerating urban sprawl and rapid structural change in modern urban agglomerations in areas of high seismic and tsunami risk, the synergetic use of remote sensing and civil engineering methods offers a great potential to assess building structures up-to-date and area-wide. This paper provides a new methodology contextualizing key components in quantifying building vulnerability with regard to sequenced effects of seismic and tsunami impact. The study was carried out in Cilacap, a coastal City in Central Java, Indonesia. Central is the identification of significant correlations between building characteristics, easily detectable by remote sensing techniques, and detailed in situ measurements stating precise building vulnerability information. As a result, potential vertical evacuation shelters in the study area are detected and a realistic vulnerability assessment of the exposed building stock is given. These findings obtained allow for prioritization of intervention measures such as awareness and preparedness strategies and can be implemented in local disaster management.},

  abstract = {Soft-sediment deformation structures have been analyzed at six sites of the Kathmandu valley. Microgranulometric study reveals that silty levels (60 to 80\% silt) favor the development of soft-sediment deformation structures, while sandy levels (60 to 80\% sand) are passively deformed. Nonetheless well sorted sand levels (more than 80\% sand) generate over-fluid pressure during compaction if located beneath a silty cap, leading to fluidization and dike development. 3-D geometry of seismites indicates a very strong horizontal shearing during their development. Using a physical approach based on soil liquefaction during horizontal acceleration, we show that the fluidization zone progressively grows down-section during the shaking, but does not exactly begin at the surface. The comparison of bed-thickness and strength/depth evolution indicates three cases: i) no soft-sediment deformation occurs for thin (few centimeters) silty beds; ii) the thickness of soft-sediment deformation above sandy beds is controlled by the lithological contrast; iii) the thickness of soft-sediment deformation depends on the shaking intensity for very thick silty beds. These 3 cases are evidenced in the Kathmandu basin. We use the 30 cm-thick soft-sediment deformation level formed during the 1833 earthquake as a reference: the 1833 earthquake rupture zone extended very close to Kathmandu, inducing there MMI IX–X damages. A 90 cm-thick sediment deformation has therefore to be induced by an event greater than MMI X. From a compilation of paleo and historic seismology studies, it is found that the great (M ∼ 8.1) historical earthquakes are not characteristic of the greatest earthquakes of Himalaya; hence earthquakes greater than M ∼ 8.6 occurred. Kathmandu is located above one of the asperities that laterally limits the extent of mega-earthquake ruptures and two successive catastrophic events already affected Kathmandu, in 1255 located to the west of this asperity and in ∼ 1100 to the east.},

  abstract = {Accessibility to health facilities is a critical factor in effective health treatment for people in rural areas of lesser-developed countries. In many areas accessibility is diminished by the lack of all-weather roads, making access subject to weather conditions. Location–allocation models have been used to prescribe optimal configurations of health facilities in order to maximize accessibility, but these models are based on the assumption that the underlying transport network is static and always available. Essentially, past work has ignored the potential impacts of improvements to the transport system in modeling access. In this paper we propose a model that treats the opposite side of the location/transport equation; that is, a model that treats existing facility locations as fixed and improves health service accessibility by upgrading links of the transport network to all-weather roads. This new model, called the Maximal Covering Network Improvement Problem (MC-NIP) is formulated as an integer-linear programming problem. An application of the MC-NIP model to the Suhum District of Ghana is presented, which shows that even a modest level of road improvement can lead to substantial increases in all-season access to health service.},

Location analysis is also a field that has matured and continues to evolve. In fact, the combination of GIS and location science is at the forefront of advances in spatial analysis capabilities, offering substantial potential for continued and sustained theoretical and empirical evolution. This paper provides an overview of location analysis and discusses GIS. The paper highlights how GIS has contributed to location science in terms of data input, visualization, problem solution and theoretical advances. The significance of GIS in this context is that it is far more than a mere spatial data input mechanism, which is a commonly held misconception within geography, operations research and other allied disciplines. In contrast to other reviews, the focus in this paper is to highlight the theoretical foundations of location analysis and modeling and how GIS is contributing to important advancements in this field. An overall contribution of the paper is providing a perspective on spatial analysis and how associated specialty areas are evolving and thriving, particularly as a component of GIScience.},

Landsat 5 TM colour composites of 1990, 1993, 1996 and 1999 were employed for locating training samples for supervised classification in the coastal areas of Ban Don Bay, Surat Thani, Thailand. This study illustrated an increasing trend of shrimp farms, forest/mangrove and urban areas with a decreasing trend of agricultural and wasteland areas. Land use changes from one category to others have been clearly represented by the NDVI composite images, which were found suitable for delineating the development of shrimp farms and land use changes in Ban Don Bay.}

  abstract = {Variations in the amplitude and timing of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 have shown an association with surface air temperature consistent with the hypothesis that warmer temperatures have promoted increases in plant growth during summer(1) and/or plant respiration during winter(2) in the northern high latitudes. Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45 degrees N and 70 degrees N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time(3) due to an early disappearance of snow(4). The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20\% since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer(1). Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant.},

Past studies were focused on the timing of phenological events and their cues but not on the accompanying changes in leaf area that regulate vegetation–atmosphere exchanges of energy, momentum, and mass. Here we report, from analysis of 5 years of recent satellite data, seasonal swings in green leaf area of ≈25\% in a majority of the Amazon rainforests. This seasonal cycle is timed to the seasonality of solar radiation in a manner that is suggestive of anticipatory and opportunistic patterns of net leaf flushing during the early to mid part of the light-rich dry season and net leaf abscission during the cloudy wet season. These seasonal swings in leaf area may be critical to initiation of the transition from dry to wet season, seasonal carbon balance between photosynthetic gains and respiratory losses, and litterfall nutrient cycling in moist tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Developing decision support systems for environmental applications is an intricate, challenging task. The increasing complexity of environmental decision problems, the growing number of subjects involved and keen competition between conflicting interests make decisions and decision support difficult. Decision support systems have been developed since the 1970s to help tackle semi-structured and unstructured decision problems. Despite their popularity, the success of DSS development is uncertain and many computerised decision-support tools have failed when dealing with complex and unstructured problems. This article describes the development methodology and progress of mDSS, a decision support system for water resource management that has been developed under the European research project MULINO. The mDSS tool is designed to integrate environmental (especially hydrological) models with multiple-criteria evaluation procedures. A number of prototypes have been developed and the final version is expected at the end of the 3-year project. The system's development is driven by the experience acquired in several case studies selected in five European countries. Although the main aim of the MULINO project and the DSS is to help with increasingly complex decisions of general water management, the concepts of sustainable river basin management introduced by the water framework directive are addressed as well.},

  abstract = {Although earthquakes have been recognised as major natural hazards with the potential to cause loss of life, property damage, and social and economic disruption in Canada, most risk and emergency managers still lack the necessary tools and guidance to adequately undertake rigorous risk assessments. Recently, Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) has adopted Hazus, a standardized best-practice methodology developed by the US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for estimating potential losses from common natural hazards, such as earthquakes, floods, and hurricanes. Hazus combines science, engineering knowledge, and mathematical modelling with geographic information systems technology to estimate physical damage and economic and social losses. Besides the ground shaking, the earthquake model considers landslide, liquefaction, and fault rupture susceptibilities. Depending on the severity of the resulting transient ground motion and permanent ground deformation, five potential damage states (none, slight, mo..., Malgré le fait que les séismes sont reconnus comme un risque naturel majeur au Canada, ayant le potentiel de causer des pertes de vies, des dommages aux propriétés et des interruptions sociales et économiques, il demeure que la plupart des gestionnaires de risque et d'urgence manquent encore d'outils et d'orientation pour entreprendre des évaluations de risques rigoureuses. Récemment, Ressources Naturelles Canada (NRCan) a adopté Hazus, une méthodologie de meilleure pratique standardisée développée par l'US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), servant à estimer les pertes potentielles causées par les risques naturels communs, comme les séismes, les inondations et les ouragans.

  abstract = {Change detection studies in remote sensing operate with the notion that a quantifiable difference in an object's spectral value, from one time period to another, represents a physical change on the ground. To confound this premise, other factors, such as atmospheric conditions and illumination geometry, can influence an object's spectral response. For this reason, a common first step in digital change detection is the task of image‐to‐image normalization. In this Technical Note, we present an efficient method for radiometric normalization of images by converting Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) pixel values into their respective ordinal ranks. To demonstrate this normalization approach, raw and ranked Landsat near‐infrared (NIR) image pairs, with a 6‐year lag, were differenced to detect change in forest cover located in central British Columbia, Canada. Results demonstrate that ranking values prior to image differencing improves detection of change. The ease and efficiency of the approach is promising for automation and studies of change over large areas.}

  abstract = {This paper describes new extensions to the previously published multivariate alteration detection (MAD) method for change detection in bi-temporal, multi- and hypervariate data such as remote sensing imagery. Much like boosting methods often applied in data mining work, the iteratively reweighted (IR) MAD method in a series of iterations places increasing focus on "difficult" observations, here observations whose change status over time is uncertain. The MAD method is based on the established technique of canonical correlation analysis: for the multivariate data acquired at two points in time and covering the same geographical region, we calculate the canonical variates and subtract them from each other. These orthogonal differences contain maximum information on joint change in all variables (spectral bands). The change detected in this fashion is invariant to separate linear (affine) transformations in the originally measured variables at the two points in time, such as 1) changes in gain and offset in the measuring device used to acquire the data, 2) data normalization or calibration schemes that are linear (affine) in the gray values of the original variables, or 3) orthogonal or other affine transformations, such as principal component (PC) or maximum autocorrelation factor (MAF) transformations. The IR-MAD method first calculates ordinary canonical and original MAD variates. In the following iterations we apply different weights to the observations, large weights being assigned to observations that show little change, i.e., for which the sum of squared, standardized MAD variates is small, and small weights being assigned to observations for which the sum is large. Like the original MAD method, the iterative extension is invariant to linear (affine) transformations of the original variables. To stabilize solutions to the (IR-)MAD problem, some form of regularization may be needed. This is especially useful for work on hyperspectral data. This paper describes or- - dinary two-set canonical correlation analysis, the MAD transformation, the iterative extension, and three regularization schemes. A simple case with real Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data at one point in time and (partly) constructed data at the other point in time that demonstrates the superiority of the iterative scheme over the original MAD method is shown. Also, examples with SPOT High Resolution Visible data from an agricultural region in Kenya, and hyperspectral airborne HyMap data from a small rural area in southeastern Germany are given. The latter case demonstrates the need for regularization},

With a horizontal resolution of 3 arc sec, SRTM represents the best quality, freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) worldwide. Since the SRTM elevation data are unedited, they contain occasional voids, or gaps, where the terrain lay in the radar beam's shadow or in areas of extremely low radar backscatter, such as sea, dams, lakes and virtually any water‐covered surface. In contrast to the short duration of the SRTM mission, the ongoing Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) is continuously collecting elevation information with a horizontal resolution of 15 m. In this paper we compared DEM products created from SRTM data with respective products created from ASTER stereo‐pairs. The study areas were located in Crete, Greece. Absolute DEMs produced photogrammetricaly from ASTER using differentially corrected GPS measurements provided the benchmark to infer vertical and planimetric accuracy of the 3 arc sec finished SRTM product. Spatial filters were used to detect and remove the voids, as well as to interpolate the missing values in DEMs. Comparison between SRTM‐ and ASTER‐derived DEMs allowed a qualitative assessment of the horizontal and vertical component of the error, while statistical measures were used to estimate their vertical accuracy. Elevation difference between SRTM and ASTER products was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE), which was found to be less than 50 m.}

  abstract = {Objective To systematically evaluate descriptive measures of spatial access to medical treatment, as part of the millennium development goals to reduce the burden of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. Methods We obtained high-resolution spatial and epidemiological data on health services, population, transport network, topography, land cover and paediatric fever treatment in four Kenyan districts to develop access and use models for government health services in Kenya. Community survey data were used to model use of government health services by febrile children. A model based on the transport network was then implemented and adjusted for actual use patterns. We compared the predictive accuracy of this refined model to that of Euclidean distance metrics. Results Higher-order facilities were more attractive to patients (54\%, 58\% and 60\% in three scenarios) than lower-order ones. The transport network model, adjusted for competition between facilities, was most accurate and selected as the best-fit model. It estimated that 63\% of the population of the study districts were within the 1 h national access benchmark, against 82\% estimated by the Euclidean model. Conclusions Extrapolating the results from the best-fit model in study districts to the national level shows that approximately six million people are currently incorrectly estimated to have access to government health services within 1 h. Simple Euclidean distance assumptions, which underpin needs assessments and against which millennium development goals are evaluated, thus require reconsideration.},

In the test, air was injected from an air injector deployed in a targeted saturated-sand layer at a depth of 6 m. Observations revealed that the air-flow rate increased linearly with increasing air-injection pressure and the desaturated zone was generated within 4 m from the injection point. A 3-dimensional electric resistivity tomography technique was effective for evaluation of the desaturated zone. The degree of saturation of the in situ soil was observed by using high quality undisturbed samples obtained by the ground freezing method. The degree of saturation ranged from 68–98\%, which was low enough to almost double the liquefaction resistance of the soil at the site. Numerical analyses were also conducted with a gas-liquid two-phase flow simulator to describe the evolution of the soil desaturation. Qualitatively, predictions show a relatively good agreement with the in situ measurements of the 3D electric resistivity tomography and are quantitatively compatible with the in-field degree of saturation measured indirectly by using the frozen soil samples. Actual liquefaction resistance was evaluated utilizing the undisturbed samples by conducting a triaxial test under cyclic shear conditions, which revealed that desaturated samples were indeed less susceptible to liquefaction compared with the fully saturated samples.}

  abstract = {Exploiting imaging spectrometer data with machine learning algorithms has been demonstrated to be an excellent choice for mapping ecologically meaningful land cover categories in spectrally complex urban environments. However, the potential of kernel-based regression techniques for quantitatively analyzing urban composition has not yet been fully explored. To a great extent, this can be explained by difficulties in deriving quantitative training information that reliably represents pairs of spectral signatures with associated land cover fractions needed for empirical modeling. In this paper we present an approach to circumvent this limitation by combining support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data to map sub-pixel fractions of single urban land cover categories of interest. This approach was tested on Hyperspectral Mapper (HyMap) data acquired over Berlin, Germany. Fraction estimates were validated with extensive manual mappings and compared to fractions derived from multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Our regression results demonstrate that the sets of multiple mixtures yielded high accuracies for quantitative estimates for four spectrally complex urban land cover types, i.e., fractions of impervious rooftops and pavements, as well as grass- and tree-covered areas. Despite the extrapolation uncertainty of SVR, which resulted in fraction values below 0\% and above 100\%, physically meaningful model outputs were reported for a clear majority of pixels, and visual inspection underpinned the quality of produced fraction maps. Statistical accuracy assessment with detailed reference information for 92 urban blocks showed linear relations with R2 values of 0.86, 0.58, 0.81 and 0.85 for the four categories, respectively. Mean absolute errors (MAE) ranged from 6.4 to 12.8\% and block-wise sums of the four individually modeled category fractions were always around 100\%. Results of MESMA followed similar trends, but with slightly lower accuracies. Our findings demonstrate that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data enable the use of empirical regression for sub-pixel mapping. Thus, the strengths of kernel-based approaches for quantifying urban land cover from imaging spectrometer data can be well utilized. Remaining uncertainties and limitations were related to the known phenomena of spectral similarity or ambiguity of urban materials, the spectral deficiencies in shaded areas, or the dependency on comprehensive and representative spectral libraries. Therefore, the suggested workflow constitutes a new flexible and extendable universal modeling approach to map land cover fractions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

We evaluated five advanced regression algorithms combined with synthetically mixed training data for quantifying urban land cover from HyMap data at 3.6 and 9 m spatial resolution. Methods included support vector regression (SVR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), artificial neural networks (NN), random forest regression (RFR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Our experiments demonstrate that both kernel methods SVR and KRR yield high accuracies for mapping complex urban surface types, i.e., rooftops, pavements, grass- and tree-covered areas. SVR and KRR models proved to be stable with regard to the spatial and spectral differences between both images and effectively utilized the higher complexity of the synthetic training mixtures for improving estimates for coarser resolution data. Observed deficiencies mainly relate to known problems arising from spectral similarities or shadowing. The remaining regressors either revealed erratic (NN) or limited (RFR and PLSR) performances when comprehensively mapping urban land cover. Our findings suggest that the combination of kernel-based regression methods, such as SVR and KRR, with synthetically mixed training data is well suited for quantifying urban land cover from imaging spectrometer data at multiple scales.},

A number of pixel based classification algorithms have been developed over the past years for the analysis of remotely sensed data. The most notable include the maximum likelihood classifier (MLC), support vector machines (SVMs) and the decision trees (DTs). The DTs in particular offer advantages not provided by other approaches. They are computationally fast and make no statistical assumptions regarding the distribution of data. The challenge to using DTs lies in the determination of the "best" tree structure and the decision boundaries. Recent developments in the field of data mining have however, provided an alternative for overcoming the above shortcomings. In this study, we analysed the potential of DTs as one technique for data mining for the analysis of the 1986 and 2001 Landsat TM and ETM+ datasets, respectively. The results were compared with those obtained using SVMs, and MLC. Overall, acceptable accuracies of over 85\% were obtained in all the cases. In general, the DTs performed better than both MLC and SVMs. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {The recent algorithms developed for biophysical variables assessment require accurate surface reflectance measurements. This article describes algorithms used for atmospheric correction of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Atmospheric corrections include Rayleigh scattering, gaseous absorption, and aerosol scattering in three visible channels (480 nm, 560 nm, and 660 nm), and the near-infrared channel (830 nm). Atmospheric constituents such as water vapor and ozone are extracted from climatology data sets, while aerosol optical depths (AODs) are derived from the TM scene itself by adopting the dark target approach. The dark target pixels are identified, and their reflectances in the visible channels are estimated using TM Channel 7 (2.1 ??m). Atmospheric transmittance and aerosol optical depth are derived for 16 grid points equally distributed over the scene, then interpolated to match the TM spatial resolution. This technique considerably reduces the computing time without decreasing the accuracy. These algorithms were tested using 11 TM scenes over a wide variety of sites, including forest, crop, and semiarid areas. The AOD in the blue, green, and red channels retrieved using the dark target technique was validated using sunphotometer measurements. The absolute error associated with AOD assessment was less than 0.15. A statistical analysis was also conducted to evaluate the atmospheric correction method. Based on data from the FIFE (First ISLSCP Field Experiment) experiment, the absolute error between ground measurements and TM reflectance was less than 0.015 in the visible channels, and less than 0.08 in the near-infrared channel.},

Remote sensing data from panchromatic systems have a potential for more detailed and accurate mapping of the urban environment with details of sub-meter ground resolution, but at the same time, they present additional complexities for information mining. In this study, very high-resolution panchromatic images from QuickBird and WorldView-1 have been used to accurately classify the land-use of four different urban environments: Las Vegas (U.S.A.), Rome (Italy), Washington D.C. (U.S.A.) and San Francisco (U.S.A.). The proposed method is based on the analysis of first- and second-order multi-scale textural features extracted from panchromatic data. For this purpose, textural parameters have been systematically investigated by computing the features over five different window sizes, three different directions and two different cell shifts for a total of 191 input features. Neural Network Pruning and saliency measurements made it possible to determine the most important textural features for sub-metric spatial resolution imagery of urban scenes. The results show that with a multi-scale approach it is possible to discriminate different asphalt surfaces, such as roads, highways and parking lots due to the different textural information content. This approach also makes it possible to differentiate building architectures, sizes and heights, such as residential houses, apartment blocks and towers with classification accuracies above 0.90 in terms of Kappa coefficient computed over more than a million independent validation pixels. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Choice of a classification algorithm is generally based upon a number of factors, among which are availability of software, ease of use, and performance, measured here by overall classification accuracy. The maximum likelihood (ML) procedure is, for many users, the algorithm of choice because of its ready availability and the fact that it does not require an extended training process. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are now widely used by researchers, but their operational applications are hindered by the need for the user to specify the configuration of the network architecture and to provide values for a number of parameters, both of which affect performance. The ANN also requires an extended training phase. In the past few years, the use of decision trees (DTs) to classify remotely sensed data has increased. Proponents of the method claim that it has a number of advantages over the ML and ANN algorithms. The DT is computationally fast, make no statistical assumptions, and can handle data that are represented on different measurement scales. Software to implement DTs is readily available over the Internet. Pruning of DTs can make them smaller and more easily interpretable, while the use of boosting techniques can improve performance. In this study, separate test and training data sets from two different geographical areas and two different sensors - multispectral Landsat ETM+ and hyperspectral DAIS - are used to evaluate the performance of univariate and multivariate DTs for land cover classification. Factors considered are: the effects of variations in training data set size and of the dimensionality of the feature space, together with the impact of boosting, attribute selection measures, and pruning. The level of classification accuracy achieved by the DT is compared to results from back-propagating ANN and the ML classifiers. Our results indicate that the performance of the univariate DT is acceptably good in comparison with that of other classifiers, except with high-dimensional data. Classification accuracy increases linearly with training data set size to a limit of 300 pixels per class in this case. Multivariate DTs do not appear to perform better than univariate DTs. While boosting produces an increase in classification accuracy of between 3\% and 6\%, the use of attribute selection methods does not appear to be justified in terms of accuracy increases. However, neither the univariate DT nor the multivariate DT performed as well as the ANN or ML classifiers with high-dimensional data. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Rubrics are widely used in classrooms at all educational levels across the globe, for both summative and formative purposes. Although the empirical support for the benefits of using rubrics has been steadily growing, so have the criticisms. The aim of this review is to explore the concerns and limitations of using rubrics as proposed by the critics, as well as the empirical evidence for their claims. Criticisms are then contrasted with findings from studies reporting empirical evidence in the opposite direction (i.e. supporting the use of rubrics). A total of 27 publications were identified, and 93 excerpts were extracted, after a detailed content analysis. The criticisms were organized around six broad themes. One of the main findings is that the empirical evidence behind criticisms is, with only a few exceptions, neither direct nor strong. On the contrary, several critics refer to anecdotal evidence and/or personal experiences, which have limited value as scientific evidence. Another finding is that a number of critics make claims about rubrics with a narrow conceptualization of rubrics in mind. One prevalent assumption is that rubrics are only used for high stakes testing and/or other summative assessment situations. Based on these findings, we advocate a more pragmatic approach to rubrics, where potential limitations of rubrics are investigated empirically and decisions are based on scientific data.},

Domestic water use/demand is a complex element of socio-economic and physical characteristics, urban planning strategies, infrastructures and public water policies. Under a GIS environment, these factors correspond to different thematic layers, such as road network distance, distance from the city centre, distance from the coastline, topographic slope, land use/land cover, General Urban Plan of Mytilene, areas in which buildings with less than two storeys are allowed, the respective areas of buildings with more than two storeys, present population density and existing water supply and sewerage system. The Analytical Hierarchy Process applied in the evaluation of these factors led to spatial potential water demand map, which was classified into five priority zones. Results showed that a large percentage of the study area was identified as very high and high priority areas for future domestic water demand. The applied method was verified against the prepared maps showing the varying rates of water consumption and active water connections. The comparative evaluation of these maps validated the accuracy of the proposed method which can be used by the local officials of Mytilene in adopting policies and strategies aiming towards sustainable water resource management and development.},

  abstract = {Radiometric corrections serve to remove the effects that alter the spectral characteristics of land features, except for actual changes in ground target, becoming mandatory in multi-sensor, multi-date studies. In this paper, we evaluate the effects of two types of radiometric correction methods (absolute and relative) for the determination of land cover changes, using Landsat TM and Landsat ETM+ images. In addition, we present an improvement made to the relative correction method addressed. Absolute correction includes a cross-calibration between TM and ETM+ images, and the application of an atmospheric correction protocol. Relative correction normalizes the images using pseudo-invariant features (PIFs) selected through band-to-band PCA analysis. We present a new algorithm for PIFs selection in order to improve normalization results. A post-correction evaluation index (Quadratic Difference Index (QD)), and post-classification and change detection results were used to evaluate the performance of the methods. Only the absolute correction method and the new relative correction method presented in this paper show good post-correction and post-classification results (QD index ≈ 0; overall accuracy ¿80\%; kappa ¿0.65) for all the images used. Land cover changes estimations based on uncorrected images present unrealistic change rates (two to three times those obtained with corrected images), which highlights the fact that radiometric corrections are necessary in multi-date multi-sensor land cover change analysis.},

It examined: (1) the perceived landscape impacts of such development; (2) the importance attached to the socio-economic value of mobile telecommunications; and (3) the factors underlying the perceived landscape impacts of mobile telecommunications development. A postal questionnaire survey was conducted in the Peak District National Park, England with 420 respondents drawn from National Park residents and visitors, urban dwellers and members of environmental organisations. The study suggests that: (1) there was a prevailing antipathy towards the landscape impacts of mobile telecommunications development in the National Park; (2) apart from emergency uses, the other socio-economic benefits of mobile telecommunications technology were thought to be relatively unimportant in the National Park; and (3) rather than socio-demographic characteristics, it was respondents' understandings of protected areas' needs for the technology and potential health risks that had significant effects on the perceived landscape impacts. Overall, this study suggests that the significance of National Park landscapes is respected by the public, even when setalongside the convenience of modern technology, which has substantial implications for landscape planning and management in protected areas.}

  abstract = {Debate across the impact assessment community has been significantly influenced by the emergence of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) in the past few years. Although there are still difficulties regarding the understanding of its nature and technicalities, the need for it was acknowledged, and practice is taking place in diverse forms. Such diversity of approaches to SEA, while enriching debate, are critically confusing the relationship of SEA with other planning and impact assessment tools. In this paper it is argued that the value of SEA is a function of the extent it influences, and adds value, to decision making. Following that rationale, the paper suggests that SEA should be conceptualized as a framework, defined by core elements, that are incrementally integrated into policy and planning procedures and practices, whatever decision-making system in place. It is believed that in this way SEA may better satisfy one of its acknowledged aims and benefits, which is to help achieve sustainable development by changing the way decisions are made.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the potential applications of satellite remote sensing to regional science research in urban settings. Regional science is the study of social problems that have a spatial dimension. The availability of satellite remote sensing data has increased significantly in the last two decades, and these data constitute a useful data source for mapping the composition of urban settings and analyzing changes over time. The increasing spatial resolution of commercial satellite imagery has influenced the emergence of new research and applications of regional science in urban settlements because it is now possible to identify individual objects of the urban fabric. The most common applications found in the literature are the detection of urban deprivation hot spots, quality of life index assessment, urban growth analysis, house value estimation, urban population estimation and urban social vulnerability assessment. The satellite remote sensing imagery used in these applications has medium, high or very high spatial resolution, such as images from Landsat MSS, Landsat TM and ETM+, SPOT, ASTER, IRS, Ikonos and QuickBird. Consistent relationships between socio-economic variables derived from censuses and field surveys and proxy variables of vegetation coverage measured from satellite remote sensing data have been found in several cities in the US. Different approaches and techniques have been applied successfully around the world, but local research is always needed to account for the unique elements of each place. Spectral mixture analysis, object-oriented classifications and image texture measures are some of the techniques of image processing that have been implemented with good results. Many regional scientists remain skeptical that satellite remote sensing will produce useful information for their work. More local research is needed to demonstrate the real potential and utility of satellite remote sensing for regional science in urban environments. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Past researchers have anticipated the occurrence of a great earthquake in the central Himalayas in the near future. This may cause serious damage in the Kathmandu Valley, which sits on an ancient lake bed zone, with lacustrine sediments of more than 500 m depth. In this study, the predominant frequency of ground motion is evaluated using the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) spectral ratio technique and recordings of ambient noise. The results of the H/V ratio show two peaks in about 20 percent of the locations, which are distributed mainly in and around the center and northern part of the Kathmandu Valley. The predominant frequencies vary from 0.5 Hz to 8.9 Hz in the study area, whereas the second resonance frequency varies from 4 Hz to 6 Hz in the center and northern part of the valley. This indicates that the center and northern part of the valley have a wide range of resonance frequency due to two levels of impedance contrast — one may be from the surface layer and the other may be from the layer underneath. These two levels of resonance indicate the importance of considering the effects of surface and lower layers during the planning and designing of infrastructures in the Kathmandu Valley.},

  abstract = {Kathmandu Valley, an intermontane basin of the Himalaya, has experienced many destructive earthquakes in the past. The observations of the damage pattern during the 1934 Earthquake (Mw = 8.1), in particular, suggest that the spectral ground amplification due to fluvio-lacustrine sediments plays a major role in intensifying the ground motion in the basin. It is, therefore, imperative to conduct a detailed study about the floor variation of sediments in the basin. In this paper, a preliminary attempt was made to estimate the thickness of soft sediment in the Kathmandu Basin using microtremor observations. The measurements of microtremors were carried out at 172 sites spaced at a grid interval of 1 km. The results showed that the predominant frequency varies from 0.488 Hz to 8.9 Hz. A non-linear regression relationship between resonance frequency and sediment depth was proposed for the Kathmandu Basin. The thickness of lacustrine sediments at various points in the basin was estimated using the proposed equation, and then the estimated thickness was used to plot a digital elevation model of the basement topography and cross profiles of the sediment distribution in the basin. The results were validated by correlating the estimated sediment thickness with geology and geomorphology of the study area.},

Such information is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. We therefore investigated the changes in land use and land cover of 11 residential areas in Merseyside, UK, using aerial photographs taken in 1975 and 2000. We then modeled how these changes would alter three important environmental parameters: surface temperature, runoff of rainfall, and greenspace diversity. These changes were then related to the socio-economic status of the areas, as measured by an index of multiple deprivation. The comparisons revealed a loss of greenspace in all 11 case study sites Overall, the more affluent, low density areas lost more greenspace, especially of tree cover. A major cause was infill development whereby gardens were built over. However, greenspace was also lost in already densely built-up, deprived areas due to the reuse of derelict land. As a consequence, the models used in this study predicted negative environmental impacts for all areas. The results emphasize the need to critically review concepts such as urban densification and give more weight to the preservation and management of urban greenspaces. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, visibility of the noise source, visual attitude and vertical visual angle (VVA) in different landscapes were explored. Data from two cross-sectional field studies carried out among people living near wind turbines (n=1095) were used for structural equation modelling. A proposed model of the influence of visual attitude on noise annoyance, also comprising the influence of noise level and general attitude, was tested among respondents who could see vs. respondents who could not see wind turbines from their homes, living in flat vs. hilly/rocky terrain, and living in built-up vs. rural areas. Visual attitude towards the noise source was associated with noise annoyance to different degrees in different situations. A negative visual attitude, more than multi-modal effects between auditory and visual stimulation, enhanced the risk for noise annoyance and possibly also prevented psychophysiological restoration possibilities. Aesthetic evaluations of the noise source should be taken into account when exploring response to environmental noise.}

  abstract = {Emulating natural forest disturbance is an increasingly popular forest management paradigm that is considered a means of achieving forest sustainability. Adopting this goal requires a sound understanding of natural disturbances at scales that correspond to management policies and strategies. In boreal forest landscapes driven by periodic stand-replacing fires this requires knowledge of fire regime characteristics, especially their spatial and temporal variability as well as stochasticity. The major goal of this study was to demonstrate the utility of fire regime simulation modeling to explore the variability of fire regime characteristics, with respect to formulating and assessing forest management strategies. We conducted a modeling experiment in a boreal forest landscape of northwestern Ontario, Canada, to examine its long-term fire regime in relation to forest policies on harvest size distribution. We used BFOLDS, a spatially explicit fire regime model that simulates individual fire events mechanistically in response to fire weather, fuel patterns, and terrain. The fire regimes in four large eco-regions were modeled for a 200-year period under three fire-weather (cold, normal, and warm) scenarios, with replications. We found that fire size distribution in all eco-regions followed power law under all weather scenarios, but their slopes and intercepts varied among eco-regions and fire weather scenarios. Warming fire weather increased burn rates and fire numbers in all eco-regions, albeit to different degrees. Overall, the variability among eco-regions was higher than the variability among fire weather scenarios, and among replicates. Comparisons of simulated fire size classes with those from an 86-year long fire history showed that empirical data cannot capture the variability that could be revealed by simulation modeling. We also show that fire size distribution is spatially heterogeneous within eco-regions, and provide several suggestions for forest policy directions with respect to forest harvest size distributions and harvest rates, based on the variability of fire regime characteristics. An assessment of present forest policies of emulating natural disturbances that guide forest harvest sizes showed that these are incongruent with simulated fire size distributions under all scenarios with one exception. Overall, this study illustrates the value of scenario simulation modeling to explore and quantify the variability of forest fire regime, for use in forest policies and strategies that attempt to emulate natural disturbance.},

  abstract = {The majority of the world's population now resides in urban environments and information on the internal composition and dynamics of these environments is essential to enable preservation of certain standards of living. Remotely sensed data, especially the global coverage of moderate spatial resolution satellites such as Landsat, Indian Resource Satellite and Systeme Pour I'Observation de la Terre (SPOT), offer a highly useful data source for mapping the composition of these cities and examining their changes over time. The utility and range of applications for remotely sensed data in urban environments could be improved with a more appropriate conceptual model relating urban environments to the sampling resolutions of imaging sensors and processing routines. Hence, the aim of this work was to take the Vegetation-Impervious surface-Soil (VIS) model of urban composition and match it with the most appropriate image processing methodology to deliver information on VIS composition for urban environments. Several approaches were evaluated for mapping the urban composition of Brisbane city (south-cast Queensland, Australia) using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data and 1:5000 aerial photographs. The methods evaluated were: image classification; interpretation of aerial photographs; and constrained linear mixture analysis. Over 900 reference sample points on four transects were extracted from the aerial photographs and used as a basis to check output of the classification and mixture analysis. Distinctive zonations of VIS related to urban composition were found in the per-pixel classification and aggregated air-photo interpretation; however, significant spectral confusion also resulted between classes. In contrast, the VIS fraction images produced from the mixture analysis enabled distinctive densities of commercial, industrial and residential zones within the city to be clearly defined, based on their relative amount of vegetation cover. The soil fraction image served as an index for areas being (re)developed. The logical match of a low (L)-resolution, spectral mixture analysis approach with the moderate spatial resolution image data, ensured the processing model matched the spectrally heterogeneous nature of the urban environments at the scale of Landsat Thematic Mapper data.},

  abstract = {Monitoring changes in vegetation growth has been the subject of considerable research during the past several decades, because of the important role of vegetation in regulating the terrestrial carbon cycle and the climate system. In this study, we combined datasets of satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and climatic factors to analyze spatio-temporal patterns of changes in vegetation growth and their linkage with changes in temperature and precipitation in temperate and boreal regions of Eurasia (¿ 23.5°N) from 1982 to 2006. At the continental scale, although a statistically significant positive trend of average growing season NDVI is observed (0.5 × 10−3 year−1, P = 0.03) during the entire study period, there are two distinct periods with opposite trends in growing season NDVI. Growing season NDVI has first significantly increased from 1982 to 1997 (1.8 × 10−3 year−1, P ¡ 0.001), and then decreased from 1997 to 2006 (−1.3 × 10−3 year−1, P = 0.055). This reversal in the growing season NDVI trends over Eurasia are largely contributed by spring and summer NDVI changes. Both spring and summer NDVI significantly increased from 1982 to 1997 (2.1 × 10−3 year−1, P = 0.01; 1.6 × 10−3 year−1P ¡ 0.001, respectively), but then decreased from 1997 to 2006, particularly summer NDVI which may be related to the remarkable decrease in summer precipitation (−2.7 mm yr−1, P = 0.009). Further spatial analyses supports the idea that the vegetation greening trend in spring and summer that occurred during the earlier study period 1982–1997 was either stalled or reversed during the following study period 1997–2006. But the turning point of vegetation NDVI is found to vary across different regions.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

A level 2 HAZUS-MH analysis was performed where the building inventory, microzonation studies, and site-specific ground motion hazard maps (2\% exceedence probability in 50 years) were all improved based on local information. All collected data were assembled into a set of standard geodatabases that are compatible with the HAZUS-MH software using a GIS-specific procedure. The results indicate that the greatest losses are expected in unreinforced masonry buildings and commercial buildings. Sensitivity studies show that soil classes, the vulnerability of schools, and the spatial scale of loss estimations are also important factors to take into account.},

Design: Ecological analysis with data from hospital episode statistics and 1991 census. Setting: North and South Thames Regional Health Authorities (population about 14 million), divided into 10 aggregations of 31 470 census enumeration districts (median population 462). Subjects: 146 639 admissions relating to 76 552 patients aged ¡100 years on admission, resident in the Thames regions, admitted between 1 April 1992 and 31 March 1995. Results: Residents living in deprived areas were more likely to be admitted as emergencies and has ordinary inpatient admissions and less likely to be admitted as day cases. Adjusted odds of ordinary admissions from the most deprived tenth occurring as emergencies (relative to admissions from the most affluent tenth) were 2.29 (95\% confidence interval 2.09 to 2.52) for colorectal cancer, 2.20 (1.99 to 2.43) for lung cancer, and 2.41 (2.17 to 2.67) for female breast cancer; adjusted odds of admissions as day cases were 0.70 (0.64 to 0.76), 0.50 (0.44 to 0.56), and 0.56 (0.50 to 0.62), respectively. Patients from deprived areas with lung or breast cancers were less likely to be recorded as having surgical interventions. Adjusted odds of patients from the most deprived tenth receiving surgery were 0.88 (0.78 to 1.00), 0.58 (0.48 to 0.70), and 0.63 (0.56 to 0.71), respectively. Admissions for colorectal cancer from the most deprived areas were less likely to be to hospitals admitting 100 or more new patients a year; the opposite held true for breast cancer admissions. No association was found for lung cancer admissions. Conclusions: Earlier diagnostic and referral procedures in primary care in deprived areas are required if there are to be significant reductions in mortality from these cancers. A national information strategy is required to ensure the continued availability of population based data on NHS patients and to mandate standardised datasets from the private sector. Rationalisation of acute services, hospital mergers, and plans for bed closures must take into account the increased healthcare needs and inequities in access to treatment and care of residents in areas with high levels of deprivation. Health authorities and primary care groups should re-examine their purchasing intentions, service reviews, and monitoring arrangements in the light of these findings.},

  abstract = {Boreal forests are a critical component of the global carbon cycle, and timely monitoring allows for assessing forest cover change and its impacts on carbon dynamics. Earth observation data sets are an important source of information that allow for systematic monitoring of the entire biome. Landsat imagery, provided free of charge by the USGS Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) enable consistent and timely forest cover updates. However, irregular image acquisition within parts of the boreal biome coupled with an absence of atmospherically corrected data hamper regional-scale monitoring efforts using Landsat imagery. A method of boreal forest cover and change mapping using Landsat imagery has been developed and tested within European Russia between circa year 2000 and 2005. The approach employs a multi-year compositing methodology adapted for incomplete annual data availability, within-region variation in growing season length and frequent cloud cover. Relative radiometric normalization and cloud/shadow data screening algorithms were employed to create seamless image composites with remaining cloud/shadow contamination of less than 0.5\% of the total composite area. Supervised classification tree algorithms were applied to the time-sequential image composites to characterize forest cover and gross forest loss over the study period. Forest cover results when compared to independently-derived samples of Landsat data have high agreement (overall accuracy of 89\%, Kappa of 0.78), and conform with official forest cover statistics of the Russian government. Gross forest cover loss regional-scale mapping results are comparable with individual Landsat image pair change detection (overall accuracy of 98\%, Kappa of 0.71). The gross forest cover loss within European Russia 2000–2005 is estimated to be 2210 thousand hectares, and constitutes a 1.5\% reduction of year 2000 forest cover. At the regional scale, the highest proportional forest cover loss is estimated for the most populated regions (Leningradskaya and Moskovskaya Oblast). Our results highlight the forest cover depletion around large industrial cities as the hotspot of forest cover change in European Russia.},

Since it is not possible for these heterogeneous maps to all represent urban areas accurately, we undertake the first global accu- racy assessment of these maps using a two-tiered approach that draws on a stratified random sample of 10 000 high-resolution Google Earth validation sites and 140 medium-resolution Landsat-based city maps. Employing a wide range of accuracy measures at different spatial scales, we conclude that the new MODIS 500 m resolution global urban map has the highest accuracy, followed by a thresholded version of the Global Impervious Surface Area map based on the Night-time Lights and LandScan datasets.},

  abstract = {Urban environments are characterized by high spectral and spatial heterogeneity and, as a consequence, most urban pixels in moderate-resolution imagery contain multiple land cover materials. Despite these complexities, virtually all urban land cover can be generalized as a combination of vegetation, impervious surfaces, and soil (V-I-S components), in addition to water. Previous work has demonstrated the potential of multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) to model the subpixel abundance of V-I-S components. Here, the authors test whether the technique is sufficiently robust to map V-I-S components for a diverse set of cities, selecting 10 urban centers in the state of Rondonia, Brazil, to represent a range of populations, development histories, and economic activities. For each urban sample, a 20 km x 20 km region centered over the built-up area was subset from Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery. MESMA was applied to all subscenes using the same spectral library, model constraints, and selection rules. Accuracy of the modeled V-I-S fractions was assessed using high-resolution images mosaicked from digital aerial videography. Modeled fractions and reference fractions were highly correlated, with R-2 values exceeding 0.75 for all materials in multiple cities across a region. Model complexity, or the number of endmembers required to accurately model each pixel, was correlated with the degree of human impact on the landscape. Built-up areas, as delineated by model complexity, exhibited a strong fit to the well-established relationship between the built-up area of a settlement and its population. Finally, this work demonstrates that the V-I-S components as modeled by MESMA can capture both inter- and intraurban variability, suggesting that these data products could contribute to comparative studies of urbanizing areas through time and across regions.},

Terrain analysis enables evaluation of landform changes in the two sub-watersheds which indicate differences in the denudational history of adjoining watersheds. It is demonstrated that the domainal variations in the lithology and structural complexity are reflected in differences in the denudational history which in turn is manifested in the geomorphic parameters.

Greater Jakarta (Jabodetabek) has emerged as the world's second largest urban area, with a population of 28 million in 2010, where urban expansion has a significant impact on the local as well as the global environment. Efforts to control urban expansion must start from a clear understanding of its various driving forces at a local, regional, and global level. Studies of the interdependencies between these driving forces in the local spatial relationships in emerging Asian megacities remain limited. This study explores the driving forces of urban expansion in Jabodetabek by considering local spatial dependency and analyzes the spatial characteristics of this urbanized area as well as identifies spatial variations in the relationship between urban expansion and its driving forces by using Geographically Weighted Regression. The presented findings show that the driving forces affecting urban expansion in the Jabodetabek region vary spatially. Owing to the influence of the global and regional economies on Jabodetabek, we find that the demographic, infrastructural, and natural elements driving forces significantly affect urban expansion in this region according to location. Outside the core of this megacity, urban expansion in most areas is significantly affected by local demographic as well as infrastructural driving forces. Jakarta city, as the core of the Jabodetabek megacity, is becoming independent of these local driving forces, however, since it is now more characterized as a global city and thus tending to have more linkages with the world market.},

In this study, a contribution index was proposed to explore the effect of urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) using Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived data with high temporal resolution. The analysis indicated that different zones and landscapes make diurnally and seasonally different contributions to the regional thermal environment. The differences in contributions by the three main functional zones resulted from differences in their landscape compositions. The roles of landscapes in this process varied diurnally and seasonally. Urban land was the most important contributor to increases in regional LSTs. The contributions of cropland and forest varied distinctly between daytime and nighttime owing to differences in their thermal inertias. Vegetation had a notable cooling effect as the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) increased during summer. However, when the NDVI reached a certain value, the nighttime LST shifted markedly in other seasons. The results suggest that urban design based on vegetation partitions would be effective for regulating the thermal environment.

The brightness temperature can be computed from the digital number (DN) of TM6 data using the equation provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, a proper algorithm for retrieving LST from the only one thermal band of the sensor still remains unavailable due to many diYculties in the atmospheric correction. Based on thermal radiance transfer equation, an attempt has been made in the paper to develop a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from Landsat TM6 data. Three parameters are required for the algorithm: emissivity, transmittance and eVective mean atmospheric temperature. Method about determination of atmo- spheric transmittance is given in the paper through the simulation of atmospheric conditions with LOWTRAN 7 program. A practicable approach of estimating eVective mean atmospheric temperature from local meteorological observation is also proposed in the paper when the in situ atmospheric pro? le data is unavailable at the satellite pass, which is generally the case in the real world especially for the images in the past. Sensitivity analysis of the algorithm indicates that the possible error of ground emissivity, which is diYcult to estimate, has relatively insigni? cant impact on the probable LST estimation error dT , which is sensible to the possible error of transmittance dt6 and mean atmospheric temperature dT a. Validation of the simulated data for various situations of seven typical atmospheres indicates that the algorithm is able to provide an accurate LST retrieval from TM6 data. The LST diVerence between the retrieved and the simulated ones is less than 0.4°C for most situations.

  abstract = {Forest fires are a major hazard in Mediterranean countries, with an average of 45,000 fires per year. Discrimination of different degrees of burn severity is critical to improve management of fire-affected areas. In this work, an unmixing-based methodology was evaluated in three Mediterranean study areas to estimate burn severity from medium spatial resolution optical satellite data. Post-fire Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images were unmixed into four fraction images: non-photosynthetic vegetation and ash (NPV-Ash), green vegetation (GV), soil and shade using Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA). MESMA decomposes each pixel using different combinations of potential endmembers, overcoming the Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis limitation of using the same number of endmembers to model all image pixels. Next, a decision tree was used to classify the shade normalized fraction images into four classes: unburned and low, moderate, and high levels of burn severity. Finally, the burn severity estimates were validated using error matrix, producer and user accuracies per class, and κ statistic. For reference data, we used 50 plots per class defined from a 50. cm post-fire orthophotography (proportion of dead tree. ¡ 50\%, low severity; proportion of dead tree between 50 and 90\%, moderate severity; and proportion of dead tree ¿ 90\%, high severity). MESMA-based burn severity estimates showed a high accuracy (0.80, 0.80, and 0.78) for the three test sites. We conclude that the proposed MESMA based methodology is valid to accurately map burn severity in Mediterranean countries from moderate resolution satellite data. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A procedure for the monitoring an urban heat island (UHI) was developed and tested over a selected location in the Midwestern United States. Nine counties in central Indiana were selected and their UHI patterns were modeled. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) images taken in 2005 were used for the research. The images were sorted based on cloud cover over the study area. The resulting 94 day and night images were used for the modeling. The technique of process convolution was then applied to the images in order to characterize the UHIs. This process helped to characterize the LST data into a continuous surface and the UHI data into a series of Gaussian functions. The diurnal temperature profiles and UHI intensity attributes (minimum, maximum and magnitude) of the characterized images were analyzed for variations. Skin temperatures within any given image varied between 2-15??ring operatorC and 2-8??ring operatorC for the day and night images, respectively. The magnitude of the UHI varied from 1-5??ring operatorC and 1-3??ring operatorC over the daytime and nighttime images, respectively. Three dimensional (3-D) models of the day and night images were generated and visually explored for patterns through animation. A strong and clearly evident UHI was identified extending north of Marion County well into Hamilton County. This information coincides with the development and expansion of northern Marion County during the past few years in contrast to the southern part. To further explore these results, an Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) 2004 land use land cover (LULC) dataset was analyzed with respect to the characterized UHI. The areas with maximum heat signatures were found to have a strong correlation with impervious surfaces. The entire process of information extraction was automated in order to facilitate the mining of UHI patterns at a global scale. This research has proved to be promising approach for the modeling and mining of UHIs from large amount of remote sensing images. Furthermore, this research also aids in 3-D diachronic analysis. ?? 2008 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

The conflicting interest of the agents can delay or block the construction of new facilities. This paper presents a new decision support system, based on Geographic Information Systems, designed to overcome the problems posed by the agents and thus achieve a consensual selection of locations and overcome the problems deriving from their preliminary differing preferences.

The model also includes requirements for reliability in the solutions – i.e., the solution must ensure that all demands are met in scenarios comprising at least 100α\% of all outcomes. A case study application using shelter locations in North Carolina and a set of hurricane threat scenarios is used to illustrate the model and how it supports an emergency relief strategy.},

Comparison of the two DEMs allowed the mass balance of the glacier to be determined as more negative than -0.62 m yr(-1) water equivalent, about twice as negative as the value estimated from in situ measurements. Comparison of the DEMs also showed that the area of the glacier decreased by around 0.3\%, and the position of its margin retreated by around 14 m, from 2003 to 2005. It was also possible to track the motion of fine-scale features in the surface geometry such as meltwater channels, and hence to determine the glacier's surface velocity, in some areas.

DESIGN Data on self reported health regarding 5121 people were analysed using three classifications: neighbourhoods, postcode sectors and boroughs. Multilevel logistic models were used to determine the clustering of poor health per area and the size of the differences in health by area deprivation, without and subsequently with adjustment for individual socioeconomic status. SETTING General population aged 16 years and over of Amsterdam, the Netherlands. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Self rated health, mental symptoms (General Health Questionnaire, 12-item version), physical symptoms and long term functional limitations. MAIN RESULTS The clustering of poor health is largest in neighbourhoods and smallest in postcode sectors. Health differences by area deprivation differ only slightly for the three geographical classifications, both with and without adjustment for individual socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS In this study, the choice of the geographical classification affects the degree of clustering of poor health by area but it has hardly any impact on the size of health differences by area deprivation.},

The diversification of the household economy and the interpenetration of rural and urban have created multiple hybridities where individuals and households shift between agricultural and industrial pursuits and cross between rural and urban areas. Farm is in thrall to nonfarm, and industry is often dependent on `rural' labour.

Zonal statistics on a thermal remote sensing image for the City of Toronto revealed statistically significant differences between high average temperatures for commercial and resource/industrial land use (29.1 C), and low average temperatures for parks and recreational land (25.1 C) and water bodies (23.1 C). Furthermore, higher concentrations of either of these land uses were associated with more extreme surface temperatures. We also present selected neighborhoods to illustrate these results. The paper concludes by recommending that municipal planners and decision-makers formulate policies and regulations that are specific to the problematic land uses, in order to mitigate extreme heat.},

  abstract = {Urban Heat Island (UHI) is considered as one of the major problems in the 21st century posed to human beings as a result of urbanization and industrialization of human civilization. The large amount of heat generated from urban structures, as they consume and re-radiate solar radiations, and from the anthropogenic heat sources are the main causes of UHI. The two heat sources increase the temperatures of an urban area as compared to its surroundings, which is known as Urban Heat Island Intensity (UHII). The problem is even worse in cities or metropolises with large population and extensive economic activities. The estimated three billion people living in the urban areas in the world are directly exposed to the problem, which will be increased significantly in the near future. Due to the severity of the problem, vast research effort has been dedicated and a wide range of literature is available for the subject. The literature available in this area includes the latest research approaches, concepts, methodologies, latest investigation tools and mitigation measures. This study was carried out to review and summarize this research area through an investigation of the most important feature of UHI. It was concluded that the heat re-radiated by the urban structures plays the most important role which should be investigated in details to study urban heating especially the UHI. It was also concluded that the future research should be focused on design and planning parameters for reducing the effects of urban heat island and ultimately living in a better environment. © 2008 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

Overall, students reported being significantly more likely to post to discussion boards when anonymous posting was enabled than when identified posting was required ( d = .49). Students who preferred to post anonymously were significantly less likely to post on discussion boards requiring identification than other students ( η 2 = .27). The experimental manipulation of anonymous/identified postings using a simulated discussion board thread revealed no significant differences in the perceived credibility of authors of anonymous and identified messages, or in the likelihood of responding to these messages. A combination of individual level factors; including online privacy concern, self-consciousness and self-efficacy; were predictive of the likelihood of making identified postings ( R 2 = .387), but only self-efficacy was a significant unique predictor of anonymous postings ( sr 2 = .05).

  abstract = {A Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied to spectral as well as mono- and multi-seasonal textural features extracted from Landsat TM imagery to increase the accuracy of land cover classification over a complex Mediterranean landscape, with a large number of land cover categories and low inter-class separability. Five different types of geostatistical textural measure for three different window sizes and three different lags were applied creating a total of 972 potential input variables. Madograms, rodograms and direct variograms for the univariate case and cross- and pseudo-cross variograms for the multivariate case, together with multi-seasonal spectral information, were used in a RF classifier to map the land cover types. The pseudo-cross and cross variograms were used specifically to incorporate important seasonal/temporal information. Incorporating multi-scale textural features into the RF models led to an increase in the overall index of 10.71\% and, for the most accurate classification, the increase was up to 30\% in some classes. The differences in the kappa coefficient for the textural classification models were evaluated statistically using a pairwise Z-test, revealing a significant increase in per-class classification accuracy compared to GLCM-based texture measures. The pseudo-cross variogram between the visible and near-infrared bands was the most important textural features for general classification, and the multi-seasonal pseudo-cross variogram had an outstanding importance for agricultural classes. Overall, the RF classifier applied to a reduced subset of input variables composed of the most informative textural features led to the highest accuracy. Highly reliable classification results were obtained when the 16 most important textural features calculated at single scales (window sizes) were selected and used in the classification. The proposed methodology significantly increased the classification accuracy achieved with a spectral maximum likelihood classifier (ML). The kappa values for the textural RF and ML classifications were equal to 0.92 and 0.83, respectively. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Climate change in cities has received much focus in the past few decades. Heat stress in urban areas has an adverse effect on human health and is expected to worsen in the future due to the global warming. Vegetation has been shown to mitigate this effect, but introducing 'green' areas into the metropolitan space is a challenging task. We assessed the thermal load in terms of surface temperature in Tel Aviv, the biggest metropolitan area of Israel. The thermal effect of four different urban land uses was estimated. Specifically, we compared the cooling effect of residential areas with high vegetation cover (referred here as 'green' residential) to that of small to medium size (2-40ha) public parks. To this end, we used satellite data of land surface temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), as a surrogate for vegetation cover. High-temporal data were combined with high spatial resolutions data to produce 10-year average LST and NDVI maps at high spatial resolution over Tel Aviv. As expected, industrial areas had the highest LST due to lowest ratio of vegetation to free space area (1\%), while 'green' areas displayed the lowest LST. Green residential and small-medium public parks had comparable thermal loads, with green residential having slightly lower LST (by 0.5??C). In general, small-medium public parks displayed higher LST than expected. Inefficient use of free spaces for vegetation, i.e., relatively low vegetation cover to free space ratio, was probably the main cause for this. Public parks had a higher local cooling effect, but a less continuous one on the proximate surrounding (30-90m from the park), probably due to their relative location in the urban fabric. Our results suggest that 'greening' areas within the private urban space should be encouraged at the expense of building new small-medium parks in metropolitan areas that lack the sufficient free space for larger parks. The outcome of this study may have key implications for urban planners seeking to mitigate urban heat island effects under the limitation of existing dense urban layout.},

Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40. year Landsat record and has enhanced capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo; surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived 'higher-level' Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area, long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission requirements. © 2014.},

Normalization process minimizes the radiometric differences between two images caused by inequalities in the acquisition conditions rather than changes in surface reflectance. A wide range of RRN methods have been developed to adjust linear models. This paper proposes an automated Relative Radiometric Normalization (RRN) method to adjust a non-linear model based on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and unchanged pixels. The proposed method includes the following stages: (1) automatic detection of unchanged pixels based on a new idea that uses CVA (Change Vector Análysis) method, PCA (Principal Component Analysis) transformation and K-means clustering technique, (2) evaluation of different architectures of perceptron neural networks to find the best architecture for this specific task and (3) use of the aforementioned network for normalizing the subject image. The method has been implemented on two images taken by the TM sensor. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the presented technique in the automatic detection of unchanged pixels and minimizing imaging condition effects (i.e., atmosphere and other effective parameters).},

The scale of this practice ranges from rubrics for single assessment tasks to national standards statements used as academic performance benchmarks for graduates from academic programs.

  abstract = {Risk management of forest fires starts from its assessment. This assessment has been subject of several research works and many models of fire risk have been developed. One of them has been developed by ourselves, for the Mediterranean areas. However environmental vulnerability to forest fires is an important part of risk; it represents, in fact, the exposed challenge to this scourge and therefore it worths particular attention by decision makers. Thus and due to the importance of socio-economic potential of forest and the negative influence of fire on this one, we propose in this work, a model for vulnerability assessment to forest fires based on the principle of the weighted sum. Application of the proposed model suggested to use of geomatics technologies to the spatialize level of vulnerability. Within this framework, a GIS was developed and applied to the forests of Djelfa in the Saharian Atlas, as originality, it will allow the understanding of the concept of vulnerability and risk associated the steppes area scale to reach a good space control.},

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the association between Saharan dust outbreaks and natural, cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Methods A case–crossover design was adopted to assess the effects of Saharan dust days (SDD) on mortality in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. The population under study consisted of residents in the six main towns of the central-western part of the region who died between August 2002 and December 2006. The association of Saharan dust outbreaks and PM10 concentration with mortality was estimated using conditional logistic regression, adjusted for apparent temperature, holidays, summer population decrease, flu epidemic weeks and heat wave days. The role of the interaction term between PM10 and SDD was analysed to test for effect modification induced by SDD on the PM10-mortality concentration–response function. Separate estimates were undertaken for hot and cold seasons. Results We found some evidence of increased respiratory mortality for people aged 75 or older on SDD. Respiratory mortality increased by 22.0\% (95\% CI 4.0\% to 43.1\%) on the SDD in the whole year model and by 33.9\% (8.4\% to 65.4\%) in the hot season model. Effects substantially attenuated for natural and cardiovascular mortality with ORs of 1.042 (95\% CI 0.992 to 1.095) and 1.043 (95\% CI 0.969 to 1.122), respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest an association between respiratory mortality in the elderly and Saharan dust outbreaks. We found no evidence of an effect modification of dust events on the concentration–response relationship between PM10 and daily deaths. Further work should be carried out to clarify the mechanism of action.},

  abstract = {A key strategic issue in pre-disaster planning for humanitarian logistics is the pre-establishment of adequate capacity and resources that enable efficient relief operations. This paper develops a two-stage stochastic optimization model to guide the allocation of budget to acquire and position relief assets, decisions that typically need to be made well in advance before a disaster strikes. The optimization focuses on minimizing the expected number of casualties, so our model includes first-stage decisions to represent the expansion of resources such as warehouses, medical facilities with personnel, ramp spaces, and shelters. Second-stage decisions concern the logistics of the problem, where allocated resources and contracted transportation assets are deployed to rescue critical population (in need of emergency evacuation), deliver required commodities to stay-back population, and transport the transfer population displaced by the disaster. Because of the uncertainty of the event's location and severity, these and other parameters are represented as scenarios. Computational results on notional test cases provide guidance on budget allocation and prove the potential benefit of using stochastic optimization.},

  abstract = {Recent reports investigate whether windblown desert dust may exacerbate the short-term health effects associated with particulate pollution in urban centers. We have tested this hypothesis by using daily air pollution and mortality data for Athens, Greece during the period 2001–2006. We investigated the effects of exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ¡ 0 𝜇g/m3 (PM10) on total and cause specific mortality, during days with and without windblown desert dust, for all ages, stratified by age groups and by sex. We identified 141 dust days between 2001 and 2006. We used Poisson regression models with penalized splines to control for possible confounding by season, meteorology, day of the week and holiday effect. A 10 𝜇g/m3 increase in PM10 was associated with a 0.71\% (95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.42\% to 0.99\%) increase in all deaths. The effects for total and cause specific mortality were greater for those ≥ 75 years of age, while for total mortality higher effects were observed among females. The main effect of desert dust days and its interaction with PM10 concentrations were significant in all cases except for respiratory mortality and cardiovascular mortality among those ¡ 75 years. The negative interaction pointed towards lower particle effects on mortality during dust events. We found evidence of modification of the adverse health effects of PM10 on mortality in Athens, Greece with desert dust events: the particle effects were significantly higher during non-desert dust days. Our analyses indicate that traffic related particles, which prevail on non-desert dust days, have more toxic effects than the ones originating from long-range transport, such as Sahara dust.},

It is found that for the city of Athens, where the mean heat island intensity exceeds 10°C, the cooling load of urban buildings may be doubled, the peak electricity load for cooling purposes may be tripled especially for higher set point temperatures, while the minimum COP value of air conditioners may be decreased up to 25\% because of the higher ambient temperatures. During the winter period, the heating load of centrally located urban buildings is found to be reduced up to 30\%. Regarding the potential of natural ventilation techniques when applied to buildings located in urban canyons, it is found that, mainly during the day, this is seriously reduced because of the important decrease of the wind speed inside the canyon. Air flow reduction may be up to 10 times the flow that corresponds to undisturbed ambient wind conditions.},

  abstract = {Water conservation is gaining ascendancy around the world as the most important strategy for water planning and management for the future decades. In the urban areas of the developed world, water conservation has to a certain extent achieved the objective of curbing consumption, especially in the more compact European cities. Urban water conservation depends on changing behaviors by water users, which may be influenced by personal factors (related to variables such as age, income, education, etc.) or may follow stimuli coming from the economic (i.e., pricing), technological, or public awareness spheres. The relative merit of each of these factors, as presented in this review, remains inconclusive, and conservation behaviors may vary in degree. However, conservation is also influenced by nonpurposeful factors, such as urban design, population, economic profile, and productive base. This article also discusses the governance context in which urban conservation practices take place. It is argued that conservation may influence governance (for instance, in the emergence of new, decentralized decision making networks) and also that governance, and especially the consolidation of certain nonpublic actors with specific agendas, may drive conservation practices.},

There were several notable findings from these applications. For example, modeling and estimation approaches developed for Landsat TM data for continuous variables such as lake water clarity and impervious surface area can be applied to high-resolution satellite data. The rapid delivery of spatial data can be coupled with current GPS and field computer technologies to bring the imagery into the field for cover type validation. We also found several limitations in working with this data type. For example, shadows can influence feature classification and their effects need to be evaluated. Nevertheless, high-resolution satellite data has excellent potential to extend satellite remote sensing beyond what has been possible with aerial photography and Landsat data, and should be of interest to resource managers as a way to create timely and reliable assessments of land and water resources at a local scale. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Exchanges of energy, water and gases are restricted or hampered and an increasing pressure is being exerted on adjacent, non-sealed areas. The negative effects span from loss of plant production and natural habitats to increased floods, pollution, and health risks and consequently higher social costs. Environmental Agencies produce periodical reports where the phenomenon of soil consumption by urban infrastructures is monitored with extremely sophisticated geographical tools but little specific research is available that describes the effects of soil sealing. This paper reviews some recent contributions in terms of definition, phenomenology, and conceptual and empirical modeling approaches to artificial soil sealing with a special focus to urban areas of Europe. The works about the effects of soil sealing on soil functions are then considered, in particular those that affect the energy transfer, water and gas movements and the biota. Soil sealing is also examined as a tool for protecting some environmental compartment from contamination. In general, porosity, color, geometry of the materials used in the sealing of soils, the quality of sealed soil and aspect ratio of urban infrastructures are key aspects in preserving soil functions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {© 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). The Earth's surface is continuously observed by satellites, leading to large multi-spectral image data sets of increasing spatial resolution and temporal density. One important application of satellite data is the mapping of land cover and land use changes such as urbanization, deforestation, and desertification. This information should be obtained automatically, with high accuracy, and at the pixel level, which implies the need to classify millions of pixels even when only small regions are studied. Balancing runtime and accuracy for this task becomes even more challenging with the recent availability of multiple time points per pixel, created by periodically performed satellite scans. In this paper we describe a novel approach to classify land cover from series of multi-spectral satellite images based on multivariate time series analytics. The main advantage of our method is that it inherently models the periodic changes (seasons, agriculture etc.) underlying many types of land covers and that it is comparably robust to noise. Compared to a classical feature-based classifier, our new method shows a slightly superior overall accuracy, with an increase of up to 20\% in accuracy for rare land cover classes, though at the cost of notably increased runtime. The highest accuracy is achieved by combining both approaches.}

  abstract = {The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, with little attention given to urban centers in the west. Western provinces, however, will unquestionably undergo significant urban change in the future as a result of the 'Go West' policy initiated in the 1990s. In this paper the authors examine the relationship between drivers of urban growth and land- use outcomes in Chengdu, capital of the western province of Sichuan, China. In the first part of this research, remotely sensed data are used to map changes in land cover in the greater Chengdu area and to investigate the spatial distribution of development with use of landscape metrics along seven urban-to-rural transects identified as key corridors of growth. Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 350\% between 1978 and 2002 in three distinct spatial trends: (a) near the urban fringe in all directions prior to 1990, (b) along transportation corridors, ring roads, and near satellite cities after 1990, and, finally, (c) infilling in southern and western areas (connecting satellite cities to the urban core) in the late 1990s. In the second part of this paper the authors connect patterns of growth with economic, land, and housing market reforms, which are explored in the context of urban planning initiatives. The results reveal that, physically, Chengdu is following trends witnessed in coastal cities of China, although the importance of various land-use drivers differs from that in the east (for example, in the low level of foreign direct investment to date). The information provided by the land-use analysis ultimately helped tailor policies and plans for better land management and reduced fragmentation of new development in the municipality.ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

  abstract = {Although cities, towns and settlements cover only a tiny fraction (¡1\%) of the world's surface, urban areas are the nexus of human activity with more than 50\% of the population and 70-90\% of economic activity. As such, material and energy consumption, air pollution, and expanding impervious surface are all concentrated in urban areas, with important environmental implications at local, regional and potentially global scales. New ways to measure and monitor the built environment over large areas are thus critical to answering a wide range of environmental research questions related to the role of urbanization in climate, biogeochemistry and hydrological cycles. This paper presents a new dataset depicting global urban land at 500-m spatial resolution based on MODIS data (available at http://sage.wisc.edu/urbanenvironment.html). The methodological approach exploits temporal and spectral information in one year of MODIS observations, classified using a global training database and an ensemble decision-tree classification algorithm. To overcome confusion between urban and built-up lands and other land cover types, a stratification based on climate, vegetation, and urban topology was developed that allowed region-specific processing. Using reference data from a sample of 140 cities stratified by region, population size, and level of economic development, results show a mean overall accuracy of 93\% (k=0.65) at the pixel level and a high level of agreement at the city scale (R2=0.90). ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Given the pace and scale of urban expansion in many parts of the globe, urban environments are playing an increasingly important role in daily quality-of-life issues, ecological processes, climate, material flows, and land transformations. Remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool to monitor rates and patterns of urban expansion, but many early challenges - such as distinguishing new urban land from bare ground - remain unsolved. To deal with the high temporal and spatial variability as well as complex, multi-signature classes within settlements, this paper presents a new approach that exploits multi-seasonal information in dense time stacks of Landsat imagery using a multi-date composite change detection technique. The central premise of the approach is that lands within/near urban areas have distinct temporal trajectories both before and after change occurs, and that these lead to characteristic temporal signatures in several spectral regions. The method relies on a supervised classification that exploits training data of stable/changed areas interpreted from Google Earth images, and a 'brute force' approach of providing all available Landsat data as input, including scenes with data gaps due to the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) problem. Three classification algorithms (maximum likelihood, boosted decision trees, and support vector machines) were tested for their ability to monitor expansion across five time periods (1988-1995, 1996-2000, 2001-2003, 2004-2006, 2007-2009) in three study areas that differ in size, eco-climatic conditions, and rates/patterns of development. Both the decision trees and support vector machines outperformed the maximum likelihood classifier (overall accuracy of 90-93\%, compared to 65\%), but the decision trees were superior at handling missing data. Adding transformed features such as band metrics to the Landsat data stack increased accuracy 1-4\%, while experiments with a reduced number of features (designed to mimic noisy or missing data) led to a drop in accuracy of 1-9\%. The methodology also proved particularly effective for monitoring peri-urbanization outside the urban core, capturing ¿ 98\% of village settlements. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Fine particle concentration (i.e., particles ¡2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5), but not coarse particle concentration, was associated with increased mortality in six U.S. cities. Others criticized this result, arguing that it could result from differences in measurement error between the two size ranges. Fine particles are primarily from combustion of fossil fuel, whereras coarse particles (i.e., particles between 2.5 and 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter) are all crustal material, i.e., dust. One way to determine if coarse particles are a risk for mortality is to identify episodes of high concentrations of coarse, but not fine, particles. Spokane, Washington, is located in an arid area and is subject to occasional dust storms after crops have been harvested. Between 1989 and 1995, we identified 17 dust storms in Spokane. The 24-hr mean PM10 concentration during those storms was 263 microg/m3. Using control dates that were the same day of the year in other years (but with no dust storm on that day) and that had a mean PM10 concentration of 42 microg/m3, we compared the rate of nonaccidental deaths on the episode versus nonepisode days. There was little evidence of any risk [relative risk (RR) = 1.00; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.81-1.22] on the episode days. Defining episode deaths as those occurring on the same or following day as the dust storm produced similar results (RR = 1.01; CI, 0.87-1.17). Sensitivity analyses, which tested more extensive seasonal control, produced smaller estimates. We conclude that coarse particles from windblown dust are not associated with mortality risk.}

This is a qualitative study drawing on Grounded Theory analysis of 20 interviews with health care professionals who have provided humanitarian assistance. We collected the stories of ethical challenges reported by expatriate HCPs who participated in humanitarian and development work. Analysis of the stories revealed that ethical challenges emerged from four main sources: (a) resource scarcity and the need to allocate them, (b) historical, political, social and commercial structures, (c) aid agency policies and agendas, and (d) perceived norms around health professionals' roles and interactions. We discuss each of these sources, illustrating with quotes from the respondents the consequences of the ethical challenges for their personal and professional identities. The ethical challenges described by the respondents are both familiar and distinct for bioethics.

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and are rarely combined. Further, within these approaches, different indicators for quantifying the UHIs are used. In this methodological study, we (1) combined data on land surface and air temperatures, (2) enriched the debate by suggesting the application of indicators for the two distinct data sets and (3) systematically quantified indicators of all approaches for the city of Leipzig, Germany. A relationship between the land surface and air temperatures was established. However, the results for the single indicators showed that the absolute values of the detected UHI in Leipzig depend on the selected indicator and the data set used. The main conclusion for future studies on UHIs is to use several UHI indicators in parallel to acknowledge the uncertainty of measuring the UHI using a single indicator and either ground measurements or remote sensing. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Over recent years, many studies devoted to large-scale seismic risk analyses have been carried out in different regions and by various research teams. A wide variety of software is available to perform these analyses: they are more or less flexible and use different levels of precision to model ground motion and vulnerability of the built environment. All are based on risk calculation through the convolution of hazard and vulnerability. This article presents a seismic risk analysis tool, Armagedom, implemented over the past five years on a variety of urban seismic contexts: Bouzareah (Algeria), four provinces in Iran, the French Departments lying along the French/Spanish border, and Overseas Departments in the French Antilles. The objectives and requirements of these studies differed with respect to the level of precision that was sought and the surface areas examined. In order to meet differing project targets, three levels of seismic risk assessment were defined based on the macroseismic and mechanical approaches for vulnerability and damage estimation presenting different levels of precision: Level N0 estimates seismic risk on a regional territorial scale based on the macroseismic approach and existing statistical data; Level N1 yields the seismic risk at a district level based on the macroseismic approach and on visual evaluation of the vulnerability of structures over an itinerary in the area to be analyzed; and Level N2 also establishes the seismic risk at a district level, but the hazard description is represented by a spectrum and vulnerability is estimated based on mechanical models. The software, with a modular design, was developed in order to optimize computation time and automate execution of the three levels of analysis. In this article, the software modules are illustrated by maps derived from the seismic risk analyses performed. We further use the available event information to test, validate, and update the methods and software presented in this article.}

  abstract = {Urban land-cover change threatens biodiversity and affects ecosystem productivity through loss of habitat, biomass, and carbon storage. However, despite projections that world urban populations will increase to nearly 5 billion by 2030, little is known about future locations, magnitudes, and rates of urban expansion. Here we develop spatially explicit probabilistic forecasts of global urban land-cover change and explore the direct impacts on biodiversity hotspots and tropical carbon biomass. If current trends in population density continue and all areas with high probabilities of urban expansion undergo change, then by 2030, urban land cover will increase by 1.2 million km(2), nearly tripling the global urban land area circa 2000. This increase would result in considerable loss of habitats in key biodiversity hotspots, with the highest rates of forecasted urban growth to take place in regions that were relatively undisturbed by urban development in 2000: the Eastern Afromontane, the Guinean Forests of West Africa, and the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka hotspots. Within the pan-tropics, loss in vegetation biomass from areas with high probability of urban expansion is estimated to be 1.38 PgC (0.05 PgC yr(-1)), equal to ∼5\% of emissions from tropical deforestation and land-use change. Although urbanization is often considered a local issue, the aggregate global impacts of projected urban expansion will require significant policy changes to affect future growth trajectories to minimize global biodiversity and vegetation carbon losses.},

  abstract = {Supervised classification of land cover across space and time is a long-standing goal of the Earth Science community. Although most past and current analyses focus on detecting changes between two or more times, the opening of the USGS Landsat archive in 2009 has enabled exploration of methods for higher-frequency, time-serial monitoring of land cover dynamics. Modifying the protocols used to develop the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD 2001), we fit a single classifier to a spatio-temporally distributed reference sample and applied the model to 55 Landsat-5 images covering a section of the North Carolina Piedmont Plateau from 1984 to 2007. A generalized classification scheme, multi-temporal sampling design, supervised classification based on intra-annual spectral indices, and design-based accuracy assessment yielded a time-series of 16 land cover maps from 1985 to 2006 with a spatial extent of 1.7×106ha, minimum mapping unit of 1ha, and mean temporal interval of ¡2years. Comparable to accuracy of the NLCD 2001 Land Cover Layer for the region, overall accuracy for a spatio-temporally independent test sample was 75\%, with κ=0.7. When weighted by class proportions, percent correctly classified and kappa rose to 88\% and 0.84, respectively. The resulting map series shows spatially and temporally complex changes in water, urban, forest, and herbaceous cover resulting from natural and anthropogenic processes that would not be observable in either uni- or bi-temporal maps. Agricultural crop area dropped from ∼45\% in the 1980s to ∼36\% in the 1990s and then rose slightly to ∼38\% at the end of the period. Forest area increased to a maximum of ∼55\% in the 1990s and then dropped to ∼53\% in 2005. Urban growth appeared to be most rapid in the 1980s and 1990s and slowed thereafter. With continued focus on the semantics, causation, sampling, and uncertainty underlying spectral land cover classification, long-term series of Landsat images will provide increasingly robust, reliable records for a growing scientific user community. These multi-temporal datasets will be indispensable for understanding past land cover dynamics and predicting the implications of future change on the provision and management of ecosystem services. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

Ground truth information collected during six field trips conducted between 1998 and 2002 and land cover map of 1987 were used to assess the accuracy of the classification results. Using ancillary data, visual interpretation and expert knowledge of the area through GIS further refined the classification results. Post-classification change detection technique was used to produce change image through cross-tabulation. Changes among different land cover classes were assessed. During the study period, a very severe land cover change has taken place as a result of agricultural and tourist development projects.

  abstract = {Support vector machine (SVM) was applied for land-cover characterization using MODIS time-series data. Classification performance was examined with respect to training sample size, sample variability, and landscape homogeneity (purity). The results were compared to two conventional nonparametric image classification algorithms: multilayer perceptron neural networks (NN) and classification and regression trees (CART). For 2001 MODIS time-series data, SVM generated overall accuracies ranging from 77\% to 80\% for training sample sizes from 20 to 800 pixels per class, compared to 67-76\% and 62-73\% for NN and CART, respectively. These results indicated that SVM's had superior generalization capability, particularly with respect to small training sample sizes. There was also less variability of SVM performance when classification trials were repeated using different training sets. Additionally, classification accuracies were directly related to sample homogeneity/heterogeneity. The overall accuracies for the SVM algorithm were 91\% (Kappa = 0.77) and 64\% (Kappa = 0.34) for homogeneous and heterogeneous pixels, respectively. The inclusion of heterogeneous pixels in the training sample did not increase overall accuracies. Also, the SVM performance was examined for the classification of multiple year MODIS time-series data at annual intervals. Finally, using only the SVM output values, a method was developed to directly classify pixel purity. Approximately 65\% of pixels within the Albemarle-Pamlico Basin study area were labeled as "functionally homogeneous" with an overall classification accuracy of 91\% (Kappa = 0.79). The results indicated a high potential for regional scale operational land-cover characterization applications. ?? 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc. (ISPRS).},

  abstract = {The cooling effect of small urban green wooded sites of various geometric configurations in summer is the object of this study. It was studied experimentally at 11 different wooded sites in the Tel-Aviv urban complex during the period July–August 1996. An empirical model is developed in this study for predicting the cooling effect inside the wooded sites. The model is based on the statistical analysis carried out on 714 experimental observations gathered each hour from the 11 sites on calm days, when urban climate is expressed. Two factors were found to explain over 70\% of the air temperature variance inside the studied green site, namely, the partial shaded area under the tree canopy and the air temperature of the non-wooded surroundings adjoining the site. The specific cooling effect of the site due to its geometry and tree characteristics, besides the shading, was found to be relatively small, about 0.5 K, out of an average cooling of about 3 K at noon. The cooling effect of the green wooded areas on their immediate surroundings at noon was also analyzed. The findings corroborate earlier studies that the range is noticeable. At small green sites, the cooling effect estimated in this study is perceivable up to about 100 m in the streets branching out from the site. The empirical findings in this study permit development of tools for incorporating the climatic effects of green areas in the urban design. Some policy measures are proposed accordingly, for alleviating the “heat island” effect in the urban environment.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing data have become more and more popular for geomorphological investigations because their steadily increasing level of detail and accessibility opens up new potentials. In this context, this paper examines the application and quality of digital elevation models (SRTM and ASTER DEMs), high resolution satellite imagery (Quickbird) and GIS techniques for the detection and mapping of karst landforms (mainly enclosed depressions) at different scales in the Ida Mountains of Central Crete. Besides discussing methodological issues and evaluating suitability potentials, we conducted an exemplary case study based on spatial analysis of the regional karst morphology. Different input datasets and processing methods are applied (GIS-based analysis, land cover classification, raster calculations, etc.) in order to carry out an area-wide surveying and mapping of karst depressions. The findings are supported and validated by auxiliary field studies. Due to the level of detail and occasional data errors, an exclusive use of satellite imagery or digital elevation models for automatic karst landform detection performs insufficiently. Our results demonstrate that mapping karst features through remote sensing is significantly dependent on scale of interest, existing environmental conditions and data quality. A semi-automatic data integration approach on the basis of digital datasets generated by combined satellite image processing and DEM analysis yields the best results, especially when indirect karst-indicating variables like iron oxide-rich sediments are included as detection criteria. The multi-component application presented in this paper provides a time-saving and effective tool for meso- to macro-scale object detection and extensive study areas. However, the potential of fully automated karst feature mapping still needs to be explored in future work. Concerning the spatial dimension of karstification in Central Crete, the GIS-based results allow differentiating further geomorphological characteristics, e.g. by indicating a significant altitudinal change of karst forms within the study area. Size and shape of depressions (dolines, uvalas, and poljes) vary considerably due to the geological setting, climatic impacts, neotectonics and elevation.},

In the case of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard Terra or Aqua, pixels have resolutions near 1 km 2 , LST values being an average of the real subpixel variability of LST, which can be significant for heterogeneous terrain. Here, we use Landsat 7 LST decametre-scale fields to evaluate the temporal and spatial variability at the kilometre scale and compare the resulting average values to those provided by MODIS for the same observation time, for the very heterogeneous Campus of the University of the Balearic Islands (Mallorca, Western Mediterranean), with an area of about 1 km 2 , for a period between 2014 and 2016. Variations of LST between 10 and 20 K are often found at the sub-kilometre scale. In addition, MODIS values are compared to the ground truth for one point in the Campus, as obtained from a four-component net radiometer, and a bias of 3.2 K was found in addition to a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.2 K. An indication of a more elaborated local measurement strategy in the Campus is given, using an array of radiometers distributed in the area.},

  abstract = {Spatial and temporal changes in urban reflectance have a strong influence on energy flux through the urban environment. Optical sensors on operational satellites provide self-consistent time series of urban reflectance variations, but quantitative analyses are complicated by spectral heterogeneity at sensor instantaneous field of view (IFOV) scales and by temporal changes in illumination and atmospheric conditions. These complications can be minimized by combining a multitemporal radiometric rectification with a physically based reflectance analysis. Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) provides a physically based approach to quantifying spatial and temporal changes in spectrally heterogeneous urban reflectance. Multitemporal analysis of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery of the New York metropolitan area suggests that urban reflectance can be described with a three-component linear mixture model spanned by high albedo, low albedo, and vegetation endmembers. The topology of the spectral mixing space indicates that mixing fractions are well constrained for the vegetation endmember and that nonlinear mixing occurs primarily between the high and low albedo endmembers. Selection of pseudoinvariant (PIV) image endmembers allows radiometric rectification of multitemporal imagery to a common set of endmembers, thereby minimizing variations in radiance that are unrelated to changes in surface reflectance. Inversion of the three-component linear mixture model for the New York metro area produces robust, consistent fraction estimates for different combinations of rectifications and inversion constraints. Temporal variation of the presumed invariant endmember sites provides a measure of uncertainty for the endmember fraction estimates. The resulting vegetation fraction estimates agree with high-resolution reference measurements to within 10\% for a 1996 midsummer validation and PIV endmember fraction estimates vary by less than 7\% over the course of the 1996 growing season. In contrast, intraurban spatial variations in vegetation fraction span several tens of percent, suggesting that the measured changes significantly exceed the uncertainty of the estimates. These results suggest that Landsat TM imagery may be used to monitor seasonal to interannual variations in urban reflectance and vegetation abundance. ?? 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Little attention has been paid to how heat-related health effects vary with the micro-urban variation of outdoor temperatures. This study explored whether people located in micro-urban heat islands are at higher risk of mortality during hot summer days. METHODS: Data used included (1) daily mortality for Montreal (Canada) for June-August 1990-2003, (2) daily mean ambient outdoor temperatures at the local international airport and (3) two thermal surface images (Landsat satellites, infrared wavelengths). A city-wide temperature versus daily mortality function was established on the basis of a case-crossover design; this function was stratified according to the surface temperature at decedents' place of death. RESULTS: The risk of death on warm summer days in areas with higher surface temperatures was greater than in areas with lower surface temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that measures aimed at reducing the temperature in micro-urban heat islands (eg, urban greening activities) may reduce the health impact of hot temperatures. Further studies are needed to document the variation of heat-related risks within cities and to evaluate the health benefits of measures aimed at reducing the temperature in micro-urban heat islands.},

  abstract = {A comparative study has been carried out on the most recent algorithms for the estimation of land surface emissivity (epsilon) using Advance Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data. Three of the algorithms are based on the Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) concept using atmospherically corrected channels 3,4, and/or 5, namely: (1) TISIBL, (2) TS-RAM, and (3) Delta day. The fourth is a simplified method based on the estimation of epsilon using atmospherically corrected data in the visible and near-infrared channels, called Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Thresholds Method (NDVITHM). This method integrates a wide spectral data set of bare soil reflectivity measurements in the 0.4-14-mum band and uses different approaches in function of the NDVI value. All methods have been applied to the Iberian Peninsula using AVHRR/National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-14) data during March 17th, 1997. In terms of emissivity, the results dhow that the difference between the NDVITHM method and the other methods is always positive, with a bias of less than 0.010 and a root mean square (rms) error of 0.012 when compared to the TS-RAM method. In terms of land surface temperature, the NDVITHM method shows a bias of less than -0.4 K when compared to Delta day, and a bias of -1.1 K and an rms error of 0.5 K when compared to TS-RAM. In conclusion, although the TISIBL is a precise method, it needs the AVHRR channel 3 for its application, which is not alway available, for example, as in the AVHRR archives provided in the frame of the Pathfinder AVHRR Land project (more than 18 years of data). In this case we have shown that he NDVITHM method shows promising results and can be applied to obtain land surface temperature and emissivity from NOAA data without losing accuracy.

The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jiménez- Muñoz and Sobrino [Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jiménez-Muñoz algorithm is used. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) signals collected by satellites in the solar spectrum are modified by scattering and absorption by gases and aerosols while traveling through the atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the sensor. When and how to correct the atmospheric effects depend on the remote sensing and atmospheric data available, the information desired, and the analytical methods used to extract the information. In many applications involving classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary as long as the training data and the data to be classified are in the same relative scale. In other circumstances, corrections are mandatory to put multitemporal data on the same radiometric scale in order to monitor terrestrial surfaces over time. A multitemporal dataset consisting of seven Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988 to 1996 of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China was used to compare seven absolute and one relative atmospheric correction algorithms with uncorrected raw data. Based on classification and change detection results, all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries-Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lead to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification and change detection applications. ??Elsevier Science Inc., 2001.},

  abstract = {Over the last decade or so, a large number of studies have investigated the possible adverse effects of ambient air pollution on birth outcomes. We reviewed these studies, which were identified by a systematic search of the main scientific databases. Virtually all reviewed studies were population based, with information on exposure to air pollution derived from routine monitoring sources. Overall, there is evidence implicating air pollution in adverse effects on different birth outcomes, but the strength of the evidence differs between outcomes. The evidence is sufficient to infer a causal relationship between particulate air pollution and respiratory deaths in the postneonatal period. For air pollution and birth weight the evidence suggests causality, but further studies are needed to confirm an effect and its size and to clarify the most vulnerable period of pregnancy and the role of different pollutants. For preterm births and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) the evidence as yet is insufficient to infer causality, but the available evidence justifies further studies. Molecular epidemiologic studies suggest possible biologic mechanisms for the effect on birth weight, premature birth, and IUGR and support the view that the relation between pollution and these birth outcomes is genuine. For birth defects, the evidence base so far is insufficient to draw conclusions. In terms of exposure to specific pollutants, particulates seem the most important for infant deaths, and the effect on IUGR seems linked to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but the existing evidence does not allow precise identification of the different pollutants or the timing of exposure that can result in adverse pregnancy outcomes.}

Remote sensing offers a convenient means of monitoring this expansion as it covers a period of 40 years in the case of the LANDSAT satellite. In some parts of the globe, this is probably the only viable means of monitoring due to the lack of other types of data. In order to monitor expansion, first, urban land has to be separated from other land-cover types. Although this can be done by standard classification processes, it is much more efficient to establish an urban index (UI) analogous to the widely used normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for vegetation. Existing efforts to establish such a UI are reviewed and compared in a common context. Following this, a novel, more efficient UI is introduced. The calculation of the new index is straightforward, based on combining the NDVI with the normalized difference built-up index. The results are promising as the index can efficiently segment urban areas, even in the presence of excessive bare land. The proposed method is evaluated on two test sites selected in different LANDSAT scenes. The new index is valid only for sensors with the same bands as those of LANDSAT.},

Surface emissivity in the 10.5–12.5 µm wavelength range is derived using Landsat data and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Thresholds method (NDVITHM), whereas mean emissivity values for selected urban/non‐urban land cover types are estimated by integrating the emissivity image with the land cover vector data. The method is applied to the greater Athens area, Greece, in order to estimate the emissivity of various land cover types found within the urban setting. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates statistically significant differences in emissivity associated with different land cover types. Furthermore, statistical results demonstrate that the method is very effective and can provide emissivity values of different land cover types with good accuracy and therefore can quantitatively link emissivity with surface type.},

Some characteristics of mega-fires may emulate historical fire regimes and can therefore sustain healthy fire-prone ecosystems, but other attributes decrease ecosystem resiliency. A good example of a program that seeks to mitigate mega-fires is located in Western Australia, where prescribed burning reduces wildfire intensity while conserving ecosystems. Crown-fire-adapted ecosystems are likely at higher risk of frequent mega-fires as a result of climate change, as compared with other ecosystems once subject to frequent less severe fires. Fire and forest managers should recognize that mega-fires will be a part of future wildland fire regimes and should develop strategies to reduce their undesired impacts.},

  abstract = {From theory to practice Different frameworks for healthcare needs assessment have reflected different purposes as well as different times and contexts.4 The life cycle model, for example, is a framework which encourages needs assessors to think comprehensively about different population groups of different ages.5 It is an attractive model because of its simplicity, but it does not distinguish need and demand or emphasise the pivotal theme of “capacity to benefit.” A particular purpose of healthcare needs assessment is the spatial allocation of resources. Geographical equity of regions, districts, and even localities (such as housing estates) can be addressed by global and surrogate measures of health, particularly deprivation indices and standardised mortality ratios.6 Measuring relative deprivation is a step forward from approaches that do not distinguish need from supply and demand, but relative deprivation cannot be used to specify precise needs for service planning: measuring deprivation indicates whether Burnley is less well resourced than Belgravia but does not help in deciding the number of coronary care beds needed in either. The definition of “need as the capacity to benefit” represents a further advance because it can be directed at specific services.7-9 It has generated new practical approaches in an area of sometimes paralysing controversy. Four points apply to needs assessment undertaken both at the level of health authority and general practice: The population's ability to benefit from health care equals the aggregate of individuals' ability to benefit. For most health problems (but see table 1) this can be deduced more readily from epidemiological data than from clinical records. The ability to benefit does not mean that every outcome will be favourable, but rather that need implies potential benefit, which on average is effective. The benefit is not just a change in clinical status but can include reassurance, supportive care, and the relief of carers. The list of beneficiaries of care can extend beyond the patient to families and carers. Health care includes not just treatment but also prevention, diagnosis, continuing care, rehabilitation, and palliative care.8 Such benefits are ideally assessed by an approach that combines epidemiological factors and cost effectiveness, supplemented by “corporate” and “comparative” methods. 8 9 All of these methods include the enumeration of current services. But other contemporary approaches to service related assessment of needs should be noted: not just population healthcare needs assessment but also social services assessments, individual healthcare needs assessment, participatory and Oregon-style planning, population and client group surveys, expert specialty recommendations, and clinical effectiveness research.10 View larger version: In this window In a new window The usefulness of these approaches can be assessed with the following criteria: Is the needs assessment about populations or individuals? Is there a clear context of allocating scarce resources (are the needs assessed in the context of priority setting among competing needs)? Is the needs assessment exploratory or definitive (is the object to clarify what should be done or just to highlight problems that are accompanied by no obvious intervention)? Is the determination of the most important needs based on expert knowledge or participatory methods? Table 2 shows how other approaches compare with population healthcare needs assessment on the basis of the capacity to benefit. In population healthcare needs assessment the concern is with the health of populations with a common condition or presentation—for example, all patients with diabetes (known or not known) on a practice's list. It recognises that resources are finite and avoids focusing on advocacy for individual groups without considering competing priorities. It is definitive rather than exploratory in that client groups are considered together with actual interventions (this is not a feature of, say, some lifestyle or disability surveys), and the needs are determined by expert appraisal of the evidence rather than principally through public participation. However, any approach that contributes information on numbers in a particular group (incidence and prevalence), the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of interventions, and the distribution of current services and their costs will be useful in practice.

In this study, geographically weighted regression (GWR) was used to test the spatial stationarity of the relationships between a set of land cover types (built-up, water, paddy field, and other vegetation) and the surface temperature in TaoYuan, Taiwan. By adopting the GWR approach, significant spatial non-stationarity of these relationships was observed and the strength of these relationships was markedly higher than from a conventional regression analysis. The differences have large impacts. If the regression models were used to derive an estimate of the urban heat island intensity for TaoYuan this would equate to 2.63 ??C and 3.17 ??C for the global and GWR models, respectively. This result showed that the urban heat island was underestimated by global model and this, therefore, increased potential to underestimate the risk of ill-health and discomfort for urban populations.

In this study, our objectives are to 1) evaluate the accuracy of this new atmospheric correction algorithm using ground radiometric measurements, 2) apply this algorithm to correct Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and SeaWiFS imagery, and 3) demonstrate how much atmospheric correction of ETMC imagery can improve land cover classification, change detection, and broadband albedo calculations. Validation results indicate that this new algorithm can retrieve surface reflectance from ETMC imagery accurately. All experimental cases demonstrate that this algorithm can be used for correcting both MODIS and SeaWiFS imagery. Although more tests and validation exercises are needed, it has been proven promising to correct different multispectral imagery opera- tionally. We have also demonstrated that atmospheric correction does matter.},

The model is based on our experience with the Department of Veterans Affairs' integrated service networks. The model minimizes the total cost borne by the health system and its patients and incorporates admission acuity levels, service proportion requirements, and admission retention rates. A common resource constraint is introduced at the facility level since treatment of multiple acuity levels involves the pooling of common resources. Realistic instances of the model with 20 potential service locations, 50 admission districts and up to five open treatment units for three levels of severity are solved in about 300 seconds. The applicability of the model is tested by an extensive managerial experiment using data derived from one of the Department of Veterans Affairs specialized healthcare services. We investigate the effects of five critical factors: (1) the degree of service centralization, (2) service level mandates by acuity, (3) lost admission cost by acuity, (4) facility overload penalty cost by acuity and (5) target utilization level by acuity and treatment unit. We examine the countervailing forces present in making healthcare service location decisions and the resulting tradeoffs from the implicitly multiobjective nature of the system. The experiment and analysis demonstrate that the major factors of the experiment have a significant bearing on the optimal assignment of admission districts to treatment units.},

  abstract = {Understanding the spatiotemporal relationships between land use/cover changes (LUCC) and groundwater resources is necessary for effective and efficient land use management. In this paper, geographically weighted regression (GWR) and ordinary least squares (OLS) models have been expanded to analyze varying spatial relationships between groundwater quantity changes and LUCC for three periods: 1987-2000, 2000-2010, and 1987-2010 in the Khanmirza Plain of southwestern Iran. For this purpose, TM images were used to generate LUCC (rainfed, irrigated, meadow, and bare lands). Groundwater quantity variables, including groundwater level changes (GLC) and groundwater withdrawal differences (GWD), were gathered from piezometric and agricultural wells data. The analysis of spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and local indicators of spatial association ) demonstrated that GWR has a better ability to model spatially varying data with very minimal clustering of residuals. The results R and corrected Akaike's Information Criterion parameters revealed that the GWR has the lowest similarity in space and time in neighboring situations and it has the high ability to explain more variance in the LUCC as a function of the groundwater quantity changes. All results of the distribution of local R values from GWR confirm our assertion that there is a spatiotemporal relationship between types of land use and each of groundwater quantity variables within the region. According to the t test results from GWR, there are significant differences between the GLC and GWD and the land use types in different places of region in each of the three time series. The GWR results can help decision-makers to make appropriate decisions for future planning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In urban regions, these future heat waves will be exacerbated by the urban heat island effect, and will have the potential to negatively influence the health and welfare of urban residents. In order to investigate the health effects of the urban heat island (UHI) in Shanghai, China, 30 years of meteorological records (1975-2004) were examined for 11 first- and second-order weather stations in and around Shanghai. Additionally, automatic weather observation data recorded in recent years as well as daily all-cause summer mortality counts in 11 urban, suburban, and exurban regions (1998-2004) in Shanghai have been used. The results show that different sites (city center or surroundings) have experienced different degrees of warming as a result of increasing urbanization. In turn, this has resulted in a more extensive urban heat island effect, causing additional hot days and heat waves in urban regions compared to rural locales. An examination of summer mortality rates in and around Shanghai yields heightened heat-related mortality in urban regions, and we conclude that the UHI is directly responsible, acting to worsen the adverse health effects from exposure to extreme thermal conditions.},

This algorithm is based on an empirical rotation model and was tested on Landsat image pairs over the Cherokee National Forest, Tennessee; Uinta–Wasatch–Cache National Forest, Utah; San Juan National Forest, Colorado; and Sinkyone Wilderness State Park, California. The illumination correction process successfully eliminated correlation between Landsat reflectance and illumination condition. Comparison to forest-change maps derived from uncorrected images showed significant disagreement, ranging from 23\% to 45\%. Validated against high-resolution (1 m or less) time-serial images, the illumination correction decreased overestimation of forest gains and losses and improved specificity in detection of major forest changes. The overall accuracy increases 34\% at the Cherokee Forest site and about 10\% at the other three sites. The disagreement rate between change maps from the original and corrected Landsat images increased with increasing terrain inclination angle, with the relationship between illumination condition and the disagreement rate following a V-shaped curve that varied among sites. The lowest disagreement rate occurred when illumination condition was slightly smaller than that of a horizontal field. The correction for topographic illumination should be considered as a standard pre-processing step for land cover classification and land use change detection, especially for mountainous areas.},

  abstract = {Ship detection on spaceborne images has attracted great interest in the applications of maritime security and traffic control. Optical images stand out from other remote sensing images in object detection due to their higher resolution and more visualized contents. However, most of the popular techniques for ship detection from optical spaceborne images have two shortcomings: 1) Compared with infrared and synthetic aperture radar images, their results are affected by weather conditions, like clouds and ocean waves, and 2) the higher resolution results in larger data volume, which makes processing more difficult. Most of the previous works mainly focus on solving the first problem by improving segmentation or classification with complicated algorithms. These methods face difficulty in efficiently balancing performance and complexity. In this paper, we propose a ship detection approach to solving the aforementioned two issues using wavelet coefficients extracted from JPEG2000 compressed domain combined with deep neural network (DNN) and extreme learning machine (ELM). Compressed domain is adopted for fast ship candidate extraction, DNN is exploited for high-level feature representation and classification, and ELM is used for efficient feature pooling and decision making. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, in comparison with the existing relevant state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method requires less detection time and achieves higher detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {Study objective: To develop a quantitative methodology to optimally site new primary health care facilities so as to achieve the maximum population level increase in accessibility to care. The study aims to test the methodology in a rural community characterised by considerable heterogeneity in population distribution and health care access. Design: A geographical information system was used to estimate travel time to the nearest primary health care facility for each of the 26 000 homesteads in the subdistrict. The homestead‘s travel time estimate was then converted into an impedance to care estimate using distance decay (in clinic use) data obtained from the subdistrict. A map of total person impedance/km2 was then produced using a 3 km standard Gaussian filter. The resulting map was used to site a test clinic in the largest contiguous area of high person impedance. Setting: Hlabisa health subdistrict, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Main results: The population level increase in accessibility that would be achieved by the construction of the test clinic would be 3.6 times the increase in accessibility achieved by the construction of the newest clinic in the subdistrict. The corresponding ratio for increasing clinic coverage (\% of the population within 60 minutes of care) would be 4.7. Conclusions: The methodology successfully identifies a locality for a new facility that would maximise the population level increase in accessibility to care. The same principles used in this research could also be applied in other settings. The methodology is of practical value in health research and practice and provides a framework for optimising location of new primary health care facilities.},

To this end, we describe airport by a set of scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) keypoints and detect it using an improved SIFT matching strategy. After obtaining SIFT matched keypoints, to both discard the redundant matched points and locate the possible regions of candidates that contain the target, a novel region-location algorithm is proposed, which exploits the clustering information from matched SIFT keypoints, as well as the region information extracted through the image segmentation. Finally, airport recognition is achieved by applying the prior knowledge to the candidate regions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of detection accuracy.},

  abstract = {Land surface temperature (LST) is an important variable involved in the Earth's surface energy and water budgets and a key component in many aspects of environmental research. The Landsat program, jointly carried out by NASA and the USGS, has been recording thermal infrared data for the past 40 years. Nevertheless, LST data products for Landsat remain unavailable. The atmospheric correction (AC) method commonly used for mono-window Landsat thermal data requires detailed information concerning the vertical structure (temperature, pressure) and the composition (water vapor, ozone) of the atmosphere. For a given coordinate, this information is generally obtained through either radio-sounding or atmospheric model simulations and is passed to the radiative transfer model (RTM) to estimate the local atmospheric correction parameters. Although this approach yields accurate LST data, results are relevant only near this given coordinate. To meet the scientific community's demand for high-resolution LST maps, we developed a new software tool dedicated to processing Landsat thermal data. The proposed tool improves on the commonly-used AC algorithm by incorporating spatial variations occurring in the Earth's atmosphere composition. The ERA-Interim dataset (ECMWFmeteorological organization) was used to retrieve vertical atmospheric conditions, which are available at a global scale with a resolution of 0.125 degrees and a temporal resolution of 6 h. A temporal and spatial linear interpolation of meteorological variables was performed to match the acquisition dates and coordinates of the Landsat images. The atmospheric correction parameters were then estimated on the basis of this reconstructed atmospheric grid using the commercial RTMsoftware MODTRAN. The needed surface emissivity was derived from the common vegetation index NDVI, obtained from the red and near-infrared (NIR) bands of the same Landsat image. This permitted an estimation of LST for the entire image without degradation in resolution. The software tool, named LANDARTs, which stands for Landsat automatic retrieval of surface temperatures, is fully automatic and coded in the programming language Python. In the present paper, LANDARTs was used for the local and spatial validation of surface temperature obtained from a Landsat dataset covering two climatically contrasting zones: southwestern France and central Tunisia. Long-term datasets of in situ surface temperature measurements for both locations were compared to corresponding Landsat LST data. This temporal comparison yielded RMSE values ranging from 1.84 ° C–2.55 ° C. Landsat surface temperature data obtained with LANDARTs were then spatially compared using the ASTER data products of kinetic surface temperatures (AST08) for both geographical zones. This comparison yielded a satisfactory RMSE of about 2.55 ° C. Finally, a sensitivity analysis for the effect of spatial validation on the LST correction process showed a variability of up to 2 ° C for an entire Landsat image, confirming that the proposed spatial approach improved the accuracy of Landsat LST estimations.},

Design Systematic review of English language publications, 1980-2001. Data sources Bibliographic searches of medical databases, specialist medical informatics databases, conference proceedings, and institutional contacts. Study selection Studies selected according to a predefined framework for categorising review papers. Data extraction Reference standards and measurements used to judge quality. Results Bibliographic searches identified 4589 publications. After primary exclusions 174 articles were classified, 52 of which met the inclusion criteria for review. Selected studies were primarily descriptive surveys. Variability in methods prevented meta-analysis of results. Forty eight publications were concerned with diagnostic data, 37 studies measured data quality, and 15 scoped EPR quality. Reliability of data was assessed with rate comparison. Measures of sensitivity were highly dependent on the element of EPR data being investigated, while the positive predictive value was consistently high, indicating good validity. Prescribing data were generally of better quality than diagnostic or lifestyle data. Conclusion The lack of standardised methods for assessment of quality of data in electronic patient records makes it difficult to compare results between studies. Studies should present data quality measures with clear numerators, denominators, and confidence intervals. Ambiguous terms such as “accuracy” should be avoided unless precisely defined.},

  abstract = {A digital cadastral data base (DCDB) is a big investment for a jurisdiction tasked with the administration ofland boundaries. In the past, the development of such a database produced no real pay-back on investmentbefore many years of time, and millions of dollars in cash had been committed. The Land Administration Domain Model (LADM) (ISO-TC211, 2012) provides a schema in which theprogressive creation and improvement of a DCDB is possible; to allowing benefits to be obtained evenin the early stages of effort. It also incorporates the necessary structure to ensure that a useful historicalrecord of the cadastre can be kept. This paper explores issues to be faced in the development of softwarebased on the LADM, which retains the history of the cadastre, and allows for progressive improvement ofthe data. From experience gained in the development of cadastral databases of the Queensland (Australia)Department of Natural Resources and Mines, and the Netherlands Kadaster, a suggested logical schemais presented and discussed with respect to the requirements of a progressively developed and refinedcadastral database. Rather than each cadastral jurisdiction developing its own database structure from basic geometricprimitives, this paper proposes the establishment of a cadastral schema, based on the LADM, which cansupport all levels of encoding, variable accuracy and topological purity, while maintaining a comprehen-sive history. This would allow data quality to vary by geographic and temporal location and would beconfigurable to allow for country profiles under ISO 19152; thus permitting local terminology and lan-guage to be retained. Many jurisdictions are having extreme difficulty in successfully creating a cadastraldatabase, so an open source type of software development may be indicated and desirable. This paper presents findings based on theoretical consideration and the construction of a proof ofconcept database, which indicate that such a schema is a practical proposition for the development of adigital cadastral data base.},

Based on the phenomenon of spatial dependence, sub‐pixel mapping can provide increased mapping accuracy of such features. A simple pixel‐swapping algorithm for sub‐pixel mapping was applied to soft classified fine spatial resolution remotely sensed imagery. Initially, QuickbirdTM satellite sensor imagery with a spatial resolution of 2.6 m was acquired of the Christchurch area of Dorset, UK, and three field sites chosen. The imagery was soft classified using a supervised fuzzy c‐means algorithm and then super‐resolved into sub‐pixels using a zoom factor of five. Sub‐pixels within pixels were then iteratively swapped until the spatial correlation between sub‐pixels for the entire image was maximized. Mathematical morphology was used to suppress error in the super‐resolved output, increasing overall accuracy. Field data, including detailed information on the features apparent in the field sites, were used to assess the accuracy of the resultant image. Overall RMSE was between 20 and 30\%, resulting in the sub‐pixel mapping method producing reasonably accurate results overall of between 50 and 75\%. Visual inspection of the super‐resolved output shows that the prediction of the position and dimensions of hedgerows was comparable with the original imagery.}

Our purpose is to analyze and quantify LST and related environmental factors, using Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data in a typical inland river catchment, named Heihe River catchment, China. Considering thirteen environmental factors (altitude, latitude, Topographic Wetness Index, Cos(aspect), temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed, radiation, albedo, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), water vapor, COT), 18 GWR models were set up. Results showed that yearly averaged LST changed from 264 K to 309 K, with the highest value recorded in the downstream desert region. LST has the same variable trend and seasonality with NDVI, precipitable water vapor, and cloud optical thickness (COT), but has an inverse relationship with albedo. All GWR models indicated better simulation with smaller Akaike Information Criterion (AICc), and higher coefficient of determination (R 2), compared with Ordinary Least Squares method (OLS). Furthermore, performance of multi-factor analysis was better than single-factor analysis, with model 18 showing the best performance achieving higher R 2 (0.94) and lower AICc (7760). For all GWR model, 86.4\% of R 2 was higher than 0.60, most values distributed in the range of 0.80-0.99, and 86.59\% of residual values were within the range of ±2 K. Different parameters resulted in different slope distribution, which indicated that altitude is the major driving factor, followed by NDVI, and albedo. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The first decade of the twenty-first century was one of the most prosperous in Australia's history. The boom was led by a buoyant minerals and energy resource sector, contributing to high levels of economic growth, rising real wages and low unemployment. Yet, as with the nation's previous resources booms, there were marginal transformations in the economies of those regions from which the minerals were extracted. Overwhelmingly, the wealth generated by the resource boom has concentrated in the cities. Moreover, public expenditure in resource regions also remains comparatively low, and indeed tend to reproduce a development framework oriented towards extraction rather than diversification. This paper employs elements of Innis' staples thesis to help explain this pattern of regional development, and in particular the relatively low levels of reinvestment in resource peripheries. Drawing on the notion of a 'resource bank', we contend that resource regions are often viewed as a reserve of latent wealth that can be drawn upon for the benefit of the urban 'core'. Yet, we also highlight emerging strategies aimed at overcoming this and that seek to return a greater proportion of wealth to those regions from which it was extracted. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

It concludes that the practice of assessment has moved from assessment of learning, through assessment for learning, to assessment as learning, with assessment procedures and practices coming completely to dominate the learning experience and ‘criteria compliance' replacing ‘learning'. © 2007 Taylor \& Francis.},

Different theoretical justifications for the development of formative assessment, and different empirical exemplifications, have been apparent for many years. Yet practice, while quite widespread, is often limited in terms of its scope and its utilisation of the full range of possible approaches associated with formative assessment. The paper reviews these issues and explores them in relation to the development of formative assessment in higher education. HE is taken as 'test case' of the paradoxical implementation of formative assessment, whereby the aim is, ostensibly, to develop independent and critical learners, while in practice highly conformative assessment procedures are being designed and developed. The paper argues that developers also need to attend to the divergent possibilities inherent in formative assessment, if their aspirations for a more transformative practice are to be realised. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

Data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer has been used to carry out land cover classification at continental scales. The specific data sets that have been used, have substantial limitations and the need for the use of alternate data bases is outlined. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) of the Earth Observing System (EOS) will be a substantially better instrument in terms of several spectral, radiometric, and geometric properties than the AVHRR. However, in terms of its total field of view and frequency of imaging, the instrument will be comparable to the AVHRR for global land cover monitoring.}

Spatial patterns of UHIs for each city were examined over its diurnal cycle and seasonal variations. A Gaussian approximation was applied in order to quantify spatial extents and magnitude of individual UHIs for inter-city comparison. To reveal relationship of UHIs with surface properties, UHI patterns were analyzed in association with urban vegetation covers and surface energy fluxes derived from high-resolution Landsat ETM+ data. This study provides a generalized picture on the UHI phenomena in the Asian region and the findings can be used to guide further study integrating satellite high-resolution thermal data with land-surface modeling and meso-scale climatic modeling in order to understand impacts of urbanization on local climate in Asia. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Overall, SEVIRI LSTs are warmer than MODIS values, with the maximum discrepancies generally observed for daytime. The mismatches between the two satellite retrievals are then analyzed in terms of (1) satellite viewing angle differences, (2) surface orography, and (3) surface type. Daytime discrepancies are strongly impacted by differential heating rates of elements within a pixel (e.g., vegetation types, bareground), leading to a relatively wide range of MODIS-SEVIRI LST differences, with strong dependency on the MODIS view zenith angle. Intercomparison is complemented with in situ observations taken at Evora ground station. Differences between ground and satellite-derived values show high variability for daytime for both sensors, with systematic overestimation of in situ values by SRVIRI. In the case of nighttime data, both sensors tend to underestimate local measurements.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on the hydrologic cycle, creating changes in freshwater resources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that, as a result, floods and prolonged droughts will take place at increasingly frequent periods. The Mediterranean has been described as one of the main climate change “hot-spots”, with recent simulations showing a collective picture of substantial drying and warming. This effect appears more pronounced during warm periods, when the seasonal decrease of precipitation can exceed control climatology by 25–30\%. Despite the decreasing annual rainfall trend, an increase in the amount and intensity of wintertime rainfall is evident. However, the scientific question on the quantitative impact of these signals to small scale coastal watersheds and Mediterranean islands has not been answered. The state-of-the-art Ensembles dataset was employed to assess the impact of the changing climate on the water availability of the island of Crete at basin scale. Here, the Ensembles precipitation and temperature data is used as input for a rainfall–runoff model previous calibrated for the whole island with the principle of regionalization. Data analysis for the period 1970–2100 reveals an overall decreasing precipitation trend which, combined with a temperature rise, leads to substantial reduction of water availability. Quantitative results of hydrological change provide the data required to improve knowledge and adaptation policy to water shortages.},

Recently the DEM are used in a variety of both commercial and public business and management fields within telecommunications, navigation, constructions, energy, disaster management, transportation, weather forecast, remote sensing, geology, land cover classification, civil engineering and many more. All these applications could be summarised in four major categories: Commercial applications, Industrial applications, Military applications and Environmental-Ecological applications. Thus, there is a huge pressure for very accurate elevation data covering the entire planet surface. Image stereopairs form satellite sensors seem to provide a quite accurate and cost affordable source of elevation data. One of the newest satellite sensors with stereo collection capability is Cartosat. It can acquire stereopairs along the track with a 2,5m spatial resolution covering areas of 30X30km. In this study we compare a DEM created from a Cartosat stereopair to DEM created from other elevation data sources: 1/50.000 topographic maps, SRTM data, airphotos stereo-pair. The area of study is situated in Chalkidiki Peninsula, Greece. After a first control for random or systematic errors a statistical analysis was done. Points of known elevation have been used to estimate the accuracy of these three DEMs. The elevation difference between the different DEMs was calculated. Elevation profiles and derived maps (slope and aspect) were created and compared. 2D RMSE, correlation and the percentile value were also computed and the results are presented.}

  abstract = {Background There is considerable unexplained variation in death rates between deprived areas of Britain. This analysis assesses the degree of variation in socio-demographic factors among deprivation deciles and how variables associated with deaths differ among the most deprived areas. Methods Death rates 1996–2001, Carstairs' 2001 deprivation score and indicators, population density, black and minority ethnic group (BME) and population change 1971–2001 were calculated for 641 parliamentary constituencies in Britain. Constituencies were grouped into Carstairs' deciles. We assessed standard errors of all variables by decile and the relationship between death rates and socio-demographic variables with Pearson's correlations and linear regression by decile and for all constituencies combined. Results Standard errors in death rates and most socio-demographic variables were greatest for the most deprived decile. Death rates among all constituencies were positively correlated with Carstairs' score and indicators, density and BME, but for the most deprived decile, there was no association with Carstairs and a negative correlation with overcrowding, density and BME. For the most deprived decile multivariate models containing population density, BME and change had substantially higher R2. Conclusions Understanding variations in death rates between deprived areas requires greater consideration of their socio-demographic diversity including their population density, ethnicity and migration.},

  abstract = {Digitized colour infrared images are a potential information source for multi-source forest inventory applications and particularly for estimating the forest characteristics of relatively small areas. The main problem in computer-aided image analysis of aerial photographs is the presence of bidirectional reflectance, which causes the spectral values of the image pixels to depend on their location in the image. Because of this, and the lack of operational methods for radiometric correction, the full potential of aerial photographs has not been utilised. This paper presents a local radiometric correction method that can be used for reducing the effect of bidirectional reflectance. The method employs satellite images that are less affected by the bidirectional reflectance for the local adjustment of the registered pixel values of aerial photographs. Because of the different spatial resolution of the aerial and satellite imagery, the local correction coefficients are computed for units that are larger than a single aerial photo pixel. In this way, the general level of brightness of the correction units can be determined on the basis of the satellite imagery while retaining the finer spatial resolution of the original aerial photo. The main advantage of the suggested method is that it does not require complex mathematical models for simulating the effect of bidirectional reflectance, neither does it require a priori knowledge of the actual forest attributes in the inventory area, but relies only on the image data. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The divergence of new genes and proteins occurs through mutations that modulate protein function. However, mutations are pleiotropic and can have different effects on organismal fitness depending on the environment, as well as opposite effects on protein function and dosage. We review the pleiotropic effects of mutations. We discuss how they affect the evolution of gene and protein function, and how these complex mutational effects dictate the likelihood and mechanism of gene duplication and divergence. We propose several factors that can affect the divergence of new protein functions, including mutational trade-offs and hidden, or apparently neutral, variation.},

The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period.

It is generally agreed that many model processes are not accurately depicted by current remotely sensed indices of vegetation and that new observational capabilities are needed at different spatial and spectral scales to reduce uncertainty. Recent advances in materials and optics have allowed the development of smaller, more stable, accurately calibrated imaging spectrometers that can quantify biophysical properties on the basis of the spectral absorbing and scattering characteristics of the land surface. Airborne and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, which measure large numbers (hundreds) of narrow spectral bands, are becoming more widely available from government and commercial sources; thus, it is increasingly feasible to use data from imaging spectroscopy for environmental research. In contrast to multispectral sensors, imaging spectroscopy produces quantitative estimates of biophysical absorptions, which can be used to improve scientific understanding of ecosystem functioning and properties. We present the recent advances in imaging spectroscopy and new capabilities for using it to quantify a range of ecological variables.},

  abstract = {The most important characteristic of major forest fire incidents, from a societal perspective, is their potentiality to seriously and irreversibly damage regions of significant natural beauty. In addition, the extent and severity of such incidents may significantly affect the population and the environment of the adjacent areas. Following a forest fire event, effort should be made to limit such effects. Management decisions should be based on rational and quantitative information based on the site specific circumstances and the possible consequences. To produce such information we have developed an operational system for managing large-scale wildland fire incidents. Its architecture involves an integrated framework of GIS and RDBMS technology systems equipped with interactive communication capabilities. The operational system was developed for Windows 98 platforms, for the region of Penteli Mountain Attika. The fire simulation tool of the operational system that was based on a fuzzy/neural system for the estimation of fire spread and a corresponding discrete contour propagation model for estimating fire consequences as a function of influencing factors such as terrain characteristics, vegetation type and density and meteorological conditions was presented in a related work [Appl. Math. Model. 28(2004), this issue]. Several case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

This survey has been conducted in the context of the preparation of an extended impact assessment of a proposal for a Directive on INSPIRE—an Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe. The INSPIRE initiative intends to deal with a range of barriers that now prevent the widespread use of spatial data in support of good governance that contributes to sustainable development. If INSPIRE could help overcoming the problems related with the availability, access and interoperability of spatial datasets, it would decrease the time and cost needed for the preparation of EIA and SEA reports, improve their quality and reliability and facilitate public participation. Therefore it would contribute to better and more transparent environmental decision-making, thus promoting sustainable development.},

Spatial maps of the distribution of these elements are needed to better represent landscape structure within regional scale environmental assessments. We present wall-to-wall maps for green lines, ditches and grass margins for Europe, using spatial modelling of ground observations on linear features from the 2009 LUCAS (land use/cover area frame statistical survey) database. We compare different spatial interpolation methods, ranging from spatial autocorrelation-based methods to methods that explain the occurrence of elements based on biophysical and socio-economic information. Our results are 1 km2 resolution maps of the occurrence of linear landscape elements for Europe. Independent validation of green lines based on aerial photographs showed the best results for interpolation based on regionally estimated regressions relating the occurrence of landscape elements to environmental and socio-economic location factors. The results confirm the importance of the underlying biophysical and socio-economic factors on the presence and abundance of linear landscape elements. However, the total explanatory strength of the considered factors is moderate and a considerable uncertainty in the exact distribution remains.},

  abstract = {Developing effective urban planning strategies and monitoring their spatial impact requires morphological and functional land-use maps showing the ongoing urban growth processes. Medium spatial resolution remote sensing images (e.g. Landsat, SPOT-HRV) are a useful data source for creating such maps as they have been regularly available since the early 1970s. While land use is linked to socio-economic activities and can therefore not be directly inferred from spectral information, previous studies have nevertheless indicated that the spatial structure of the built-up environment is related to its function. In this paper, the urban morphology of Dublin, Ireland is represented by continuous impervious surface maps which are derived at the sub-pixel level from medium spatial resolution images of 1988 and 2001. The distribution and spatial configuration of impervious surface cover is quantified at the scale of predefined spatial entities by three urban metrics: the average impervious surface cover, shape characteristics of the frequency distribution and spatial variance. Morphology is related to land use by applying a supervised classification with the urban metrics as variables and generalised land-use categories as target classes. Combined with built-up densities derived from the impervious surface data, the classification produces morphological/functional maps that clearly show the urban dynamics in Dublin between 1988 and 2001. An overall accuracy of 86\% was achieved when a distinction was made between two broad classes representing employment related and residential land-use. These two classes are important in the context of calibrating urban growth models because they represent important drivers of urban land-use change. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Aerosol optical depth from multiple satellite products (MISR, MODIS Dark Target, MODIS and SeaWiFS Deep Blue, and MODIS MAIAC) was combined with simulation (GEOS-Chem) based upon their relative uncertainties as determined using ground-based sun photometer (AERONET) observations for 1998-2014. The GWR predictors included simulated aerosol composition and land use information. The resultant PM2.5 estimates were highly consistent (R(2) = 0.81) with out-of-sample cross-validated PM2.5 concentrations from monitors. The global population-weighted annual average PM2.5 concentrations were 3-fold higher than the 10 𝜇g/m(3) WHO guideline, driven by exposures in Asian and African regions. Estimates in regions with high contributions from mineral dust were associated with higher uncertainty, resulting from both sparse ground-based monitoring, and challenging conditions for retrieval and simulation. This approach demonstrates that the addition of even sparse ground-based measurements to more globally continuous PM2.5 data sources can yield valuable improvements to PM2.5 characterization on a global scale.},

Fifty-two publications from the last 20 years were selected through a systematic search in four scientific databases. Subsequently, all studies were categorized with respect to student characteristics, learning environment characteristics, learning processes and outcomes. The synthesis of these studies resulted in the formulation of seven design principles, addressing the instruction, learning and assessment sides of the learning environment. These design principles include the following learning environment characteristics: learning objectives, learning task, behaviour modelling, opportunity to practice, intensity and timing of feedback, peer assessment and self-assessment. Finally, an agenda for future research is discussed.},

The significant qualitative attributes to characterize hedgerows are composition, morphology and spatial arrangement of small elements. Remote sensing images Spot 5 and Kompsat, respectively 5m and 1m spatial resolution, were used. We applied an object-based image analysis method. The first step consists on a multi-scale segmentation, and the second step consists on a multi-criterion classification. Then, the characterization consists on a combination of shape values on the fields boundaries. Results shows that both Spot 5 and Kompsat image allows to detect automatically with a good precision the hedgerow network (84.5\% and 97\% respectively). Only the Kompsat image is enable to detect the finest elements of hedgerows. The very high spatial resolution image, less than 1m, allows to characterize the hedgerow cover quality, the continuity and discontinuity. This study highlights an efficient, reliable and generic method. Moreover, this characterization of landscape structures elements allows to affine the knowledge of ecological elements.},

The S-5 P mission is part of the Global Monitoring of the Environment and Security (GMES) Space Component Programme. The payload of the mission is the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) that will measure key atmospheric constituents including ozone, NO2, SO2, CO, CH4, CH2O and aerosol properties. TROPOMI has heritage to both the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) as well as to the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CartograpHY (SCIAMACHY). The S-5 P will extend the data records of these missions as well as be a preparatory mission for the Sentinel-5 mission planned for 2020 onward. The mission is pre-operational and is the link between the current scientific and the operational Sentinel-4/-5 missions. This contribution describes the science and mission objectives, the mission and the instrument, and the data products. While building on a solid foundation of the heritage instruments, the S-5P/TROPOMI mission is an exciting step forward with a strong focus on the troposphere. This is achieved by a combination of a high spatial resolution and improved signal-to-noise, as well as dedicated data product development. It is anticipated that the S-5 P mission will make a large contribution to the monitoring of the global atmospheric composition, as well as to the scientific knowledge of relevant atmospheric processes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The model is specifically developed for the analysis of land use in small regions (e.g., a watershed or province) at a fine spatial resolution. The model structure is based on systems theory to allow the integrated analysis of land-use change in relation to socio-economic and biophysical driving factors. The model explicitly addresses the hierarchical organization of land use systems, spatial connectivity between locations and stability. Stability is incorporated by a set of variables that define the relative elasticity of the actual land-use type to conversion. The user can specify these settings based on expert knowledge or survey data. Two applications of the model in the Philippines and Malaysia are used to illustrate the functioning of the model and its validation.},

  abstract = {Land use change models are tools to support the analysis of the causes and consequences of land use dynamics. Scenario analysis with land use models can support land use planning and policy. Numerous land use models are available, developed from different disciplinary backgrounds. This paper reviews current models to identify priority issues for future land use change modelling research. This discussion is based on six concepts important to land use modelling: (1) Level of analysis; (2) Cross-scale dynamics; (3) Driving forces; (4) Spatial interaction and neighbourhood effects; (5) Temporal dynamics; and (6) Level of integration. For each of these concepts an overview is given of the variety of methods used to implement these concepts in operational models. It is concluded that a lot of progress has been made in building land use change models. However, in order to incorporate more aspects important to land use modelling it is needed to develop a new generation of land use models that better address the multi-scale characteristics of the land use system, implement new techniques to quantify neighbourhood effects, explicitly deal with temporal dynamics and achieve a higher level of integration between disciplinary approaches and between models studying urban and rural land use changes. If these requirements are fulfilled models will better support the analysis of land use dynamics and land use policy formulation. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.},

The Collection 5 MOD09 surface reflectance product computed by the improved AC algorithm was analyzed for the year of 2003 through the comparison with a reference data set created with the help of Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements and the 6SV code simulations. In general, the MOD09 product demonstrated satisfactory quality in all used MODIS bands except for band 3 (470 nm), which is used for aerosol inversion. The impact of uncertainties in MOD09 upon the downstream product, such as vegetation indices and albedo, was also evaluated.},

This paper explores the potential of SEA to enhance communication between different stakeholders, enabling discussion and agreement independently of different beliefs, convictions, social roles, values, accumulated experiences, individual needs, or any other factors, that express different world visions and determine the context within which decisions are taken. To face up to this challenge the authors suggest the establishment of communication strategies that enhance the role of SEA in the construction of social expectations and platforms of discussion, in the multiple negotiation processes that take place between stakeholders and decision-makers.},

  abstract = {Natural disasters are phenomenons which strike countries all around the world. Sometimes, either by the intensity of the phenomenon or the vulnerability of the country, help is requested from the rest of the world and relief organizations respond by delivering basic aid to those in need. Humanitarian logistics is a critical factor in managing relief operations and, in general, there is a lack of attention on the development of mathematical models and solution algorithms for strategic and tactical decisions in this area. We acknowledge that in humanitarian logistics traditional cost minimizing measures are not central, and postulate that other performance measures such as time of response, equity of the distribution or reliability and security of the operation routes become more relevant. In this paper several criteria for an aid distribution problem are proposed and a multi-criteria optimization model dealing with all these aspects is developed. This model is the core of a decision support system under development to assist organizations in charge of the distribution of humanitarian aid. Once the proposed criteria and the model are described, an illustrative case study based on the 2010 Haiti catastrophic earthquake is presented, showing the usefulness of the proposal.},

In the frame of BIOSPEC (Linking spectral information at different spatial scales with biophysical parameters of Mediterranean vegetation in the context of global change) and FLUXPEC (Monitoring changes in water and carbon fluxes from remote and proximal sensing in Mediterranean ―dehesa‖ ecosystem) projects LST retrieved from Landsat data is required to integrate ground-based observations of energy, water, and carbon fluxes with multi-scale remotely-sensed data and assess water and carbon balance in ecologically fragile heterogeneous ecosystem of Mediterranean wooded grassland (dehesa). Thus, three methods based on the Radiative Transfer Equation were used to extract LST from a series of 2009–2011 Landsat-5 TM images to assess the applicability for temperature input generation to a Landsat-MODIS LST integration. When compared to surface temperatures simulated using MODerate resolution atmospheric TRANsmission 5 (MODTRAN 5) with atmospheric profiles inputs (LSTref), values from Single-Channel (SC) algorithm are the closest (root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) = 0.50 °C); procedure based on the online Radiative Transfer Equation Atmospheric Correction Parameters Calculator (RTE-ACPC) shows RMSD = 0.85 ° C; Mono-Window algorithm (MW) presents the highest RMSD (2.34 °C) with systematical LST underestimation (bias = 1.81 ° C). Differences between Landsat-retrieved LST and MODIS LST are in the range of 2 to 4 ° C and can be explained mainly by differences in observation geometry, emissivity, and time mismatch between Landsat and MODIS overpasses. There is a seasonal bias in Landsat-MODIS LST differences due to greater variations in surface emissivity and thermal contrasts between landcover components.},

Here, we review the use of thermal remote sensing in the study of urban climates, focusing primarily on the urban heat island effect and progress made towards answering the methodological questions posed by Roth et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 10 (1989) 1699]. The review demonstrates that while some progress has been made, the thermal remote sensing of urban areas has been slow to advance beyond qualitative description of thermal patterns and simple correlations. Part of the difficulty lies in the tendency to use qualitatively based land use data to describe the urban surface rather than the use of more fundamental surface descriptors. Advances in the application of thermal remote sensing to natural and agricultural surfaces suggest insight into possible methods to advance techniques and capabilities over urban areas. Improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution of current and next-generation satellite-based sensors, in more detailed surface representations of urban surfaces and in the availability of low cost, high resolution portable thermal scanners are expected to allow progress in the application of urban thermal remote sensing to the study of the climate of urban areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {In order to adequately model ecosystems services of the urban environment, it is necessary to accu-rately inventory urban vegetation abundance and spatial distribution. An object-based, methodological design for estimating urban vegetation structure within the metropolis of Phoenix, Arizona using re-mote sensing techniques on high-resolution (0.6m 2) aerial photography was derived utilizing a hybrid of image segmentation and spectral classification. Within the arid urban environment, vegetation is controlled at a very fine scale and is best analyzed at extremely high spatial resolution. Since at a local scale the urban environment is composed of discretely heterogeneous patches, it is necessary to quan-tify landscape pattern at this scale. An object-oriented approach was taken utilizing a segmentation al-gorithm that transposes imagery into distinct polygons by incorporating a combination of spectral properties and neighborhood characteristics. This segmentation process was parameterized to isolate vegetation patches with a minimum diameter of 2m, which incorporates typologies from shrubs to large trees. Once segmentation was completed, the image was then analyzed and classified based on the cadastral and topological characteristics. Accuracy assessment of land cover classification was then conducted at 200 random points throughout the metropolis. The intent of this methodology is to allow for regular monitoring of vegetation change at a broad extent with fine resolution in the Phoenix basin.},

  abstract = {Researchers have recently examined the geographic variability of the vulnerability of populations to earthquakes. These studies focus mainly on the complex modelling of geophysical processes or identification of socio-economically disadvantaged populations. However, no studies to date have integrated different components of vulnerability with metrics of travel distance to hospitals and trauma centres (systemic vulnerability). We argue that this previously unaccounted component is an important conceptual and practical aspect of earthquake vulnerability. Accordingly, this paper presents a multi-criteria model for combining physical, social, and systemic components, moving towards a more comprehensive assessment of vulnerability. An analytic hierarchy process is used to produce a place-specific index of social vulnerability, which we combine with soil liquefaction and amplification index and a road network model for access to hospitals and trauma services. Using a geographic information system, we implemented this model for the Greater Victoria region (483 km2, 2011 population: 345,000) in British Columbia, Canada. Clustering of total vulnerability was found in outlying areas, highlighting the importance of access to trauma centres. We conclude by identifying challenges in measuring earthquake vulnerability and advocate integration of systemic vulnerability components in natural hazards research.},

  abstract = {The term ‘‘urban stream syndrome” describes the consistently observed ecological degra- dation of streams draining urban land. This paper reviews recent literature to describe symptoms of the syndrome, explores mechanisms driving the syndrome, and identifies appropriate goals and methods for ecological restoration of urban streams. Symptoms of the urban stream syndrome include a flashier hy- drograph, elevated concentrations of nutrients and contaminants, altered channelmorphology, and reduced biotic richness, with increased dominance of tolerant species. More research is needed before generaliza- tions can be made about urban effects on stream ecosystem processes, but reduced nutrient uptake has been consistently reported. The mechanisms driving the syndrome are complex and interactive, butmost impacts can be ascribed to a few major large-scale sources, primarily urban stormwater runoff delivered to streams by hydraulically efficient drainage systems. Other stressors, such as combined or sanitary sewer overflows, wastewater treatment plant effluents, and legacy pollutants (long-lived pollutants from earlier land uses) can obscure the effects of stormwater runoff. Most research on urban impacts to streams has concentrated on correlations between instream ecological metrics and total catchment imperviousness. Recent research shows that some of the variance in such relationships can be explained by the distance between the stream reach and urban land, or by the hydraulic efficiency of stormwater drainage. Themech- anisms behind such patterns require experimentation at the catchment scale to identify the best management approaches to conservation and restoration of streams in urban catchments. Remediation of stormwater impacts is most likely to be achieved through widespread application of innovative approaches to drainage design. Because humans dominate urban ecosystems, research on urban stream ecology will require a broadening of stream ecological research to integrate with social, behavioral, and economic research. Key},

  abstract = {The link between deprivation and health is well established. However, recent research has highlighted the existence of a ‘Scottish effect', a term used to describe the higher levels of poor health experienced in Scotland over and above that explained by socio-economic circumstances. Evidence of this ‘excess' being concentrated in West Central Scotland has led to discussion of a more specific ‘Glasgow effect'. However, within the UK, Glasgow is not alone in experiencing relatively high levels of poor health and deprivation; Liverpool and Manchester are two other cities which also stand out in this regard. Previous analyses of this ‘effect' were also constrained by limitations of data and geography. To establish whether there is evidence of a so-called ‘Glasgow effect': (1) even when compared with its two most similar and comparable UK cities; and (2) when based on a more robust and spatially sensitive measure of deprivation than was previously available to researchers. Rates of ‘income deprivation' (a measure very highly correlated with the main UK indices of multiple deprivation) were calculated for small areas (average population size: 1600) in Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester. All-cause and cause-specific standardized mortality ratios were calculated for Glasgow relative to Liverpool and Manchester, standardizing for age, gender and income deprivation decile. In addition, a range of historical census and mortality data were analysed. The deprivation profiles of Glasgow, Liverpool and Manchester are almost identical. Despite this, premature deaths in Glasgow are more than 30\% higher, with all deaths approximately 15\% higher. This ‘excess' mortality is seen across virtually the entire population: all ages (except the very young), both males and females, in deprived and non-deprived neighbourhoods. For premature mortality, standardized mortality ratios tended to be higher for the more deprived areas (particularly among males), and approximately half of ‘excess' deaths under 65 years of age were directly related to alcohol and drugs. Analyses of historical data suggest that it is unlikely that the deprivation profile of Glasgow has changed significantly relative to Liverpool and Manchester in recent decades; however, the mortality gap appears to have widened since the early 1970s, indicating that the ‘effect' may be a relatively recent phenomenon. While deprivation is a fundamental determinant of health and, therefore, an important driver of mortality, it is only one part of a complex picture. As currently measured, deprivation does not explain the higher levels of mortality experienced by Glasgow in relation to two very similar UK cities. Thus, additional explanations are required.},

  abstract = {-We propose a generalized split-window method for retrieving land-surface temperature (LST) from AVHRR and MODIS data. Accurate radiative transfer simulations show that the coefficients in the split-window algorithm for LST must vary with the viewing angle, if we are to achieve a LST accuracy of about 1 K for the whole scan swath range (1t5.5" from nadir) and for the ranges of surface temperature and atmospheric conditions over land, which are much wider than those over oceans. We obtain these coefficients from regression analysis of radiative transfer simulations, and we analyze sensitivity and error over wide ranges of surface temperature and emissivity and atmospheric water vapor abundance and temperature. Sim-ulations show that when atmospheric water vapor increases and viewing angle is larger than 45", it is necessary to optimize the split-window method by separating the ranges of the at-mospheric water vapor, lower boundary temperature, and the surface temperature into tractable subranges. The atmospheric lower boundary temperature and (vertical) column water vapor values retrieved from HIRS/2 or MODIS atmospheric sounding channels can be used to determine the range for the optimum coefficients of the split-window method. This new algorithm not only retrieves land-surface temperature more accurately, but is also less sensitive to uncertainty in emissivity and to instrument quantization error.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the status of land-surface temperature (LST) standard products retrieved from Earth Observing System (EOS) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Based on estimates of the channel-dependence error and noise equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) and the calibration accuracy of MODIS thermal-infrared data, the impact of instrument performance on the accuracy of LST is discussed. A double-screen scheme based on the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST algorithm and the aggregated 1-km LST retrieved by the generalized split-window algorithm, and the difference between daytime and nighttime LSTs, is proposed to remove the LSTs contaminated with cloud effects. The accuracy of daily MODIS LST product at 1-km resolution, which was produced by the generalized split-window algorithm, was validated in 11 clear-sky cases with in situ measurement data collected in field campaigns in 2000 and 2001. The MODIS LST accuracy is better than 1 K in the range from 263 to 300 K over Lake Titicaca in Bolivia, Mono Lake, Bridgeport grassland, and a rice field in Chico, CA, and Walker Lake, Nevada (NV), in the atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.0 cm. It is difficult to validate the daytime LST product over land sites rather than lakes with ground-based measurements alone because of the high spatial variations in the in situ LST measurement data, which was verified by the daytime data of the MODIS Airborne Simulator (MAS) over a grassland in Bridgeport, CA, on October 6, 2000. In six cases over a silt playa in Railroad Valley, NV, the 1-km MODIS LSTs are a few Kelvin degrees lower than the in situ measured LSTs because the surface emissivities inferred from land cover types in the split-window LST method are often overestimated in semi-arid and arid regions. After a correction with the difference between the 5-km LST retrieved by the day/night LST method and the LST aggregated from 1-km LSTs retrieved by the split-window method, the MODIS LSTs agree with in situ measured LSTs within ± 1 K in the range 263-322 K for the six cases in Railroad Valley and one case of snowcover in Bridgeport, CA, leading a recommendation for use of the 5-km LST product retrieved by the day/night LST method in bare and sparse vegetated areas. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

  abstract = {This paper discusses the lessons learned from analysis of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land-Surface Temperature/Emissivity (LST) products in the current (V4) and previous versions, and presents eight new refinements for V5 product generation executive code (PGE16) and the test results with real Terra and Aqua MODIS data. The major refinements include considering surface elevation when using the MODIS cloudmask product, removal of temporal averaging in the 1 km daily level-3 LST product, removal of cloud-contaminated LSTs in level-3 LST products, and the refinements for the day/night LST algorithm. These refinements significantly improved the spatial coverage of LSTs, especially in highland regions, and the accuracy and stability of the MODIS LST products. Comparisons between V5 LSTs and in-situ values in 47 clear-sky cases (in the LST range from −10 °C to 58 °C and atmospheric column water vapor range from 0.4 to 3.5 cm) indicate that the accuracy of the MODIS LST product is better than 1 K in most cases (39 out of 47) and the root of mean squares of differences is less than 0.7 K for all 47 cases or 0.5 K for all but the 8 cases apparently with heavy aerosol loadings. Emissivities retrieved by the day/night algorithm are well compared to the surface emissivity spectra measured by a sun-shadow method in two field campaigns. The time series of V5 MODIS LST product over two sites (Lake Tahoe in California and Namco lake in Tibet) in 2003 are evaluated, showing that the quantity and quality of MODIS LST products depend on clear-sky conditions because of the inherent limitation of the thermal infrared remote sensing. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Following the severe drought in 1999–2000 there was a widespread outbreak of oak decline in the Ozark Highlands. Over 400,000 ha of dead and dying oak trees were observed by the USDA Forest Service in this region. Although oak forests that are dead can be easily interpreted from air photos or classified from satellite images, it is difficult to detect dying trees that are still green but will die back or recover in the following years. In this study, we applied a normalized difference water index (NDWI) to map the continuous forest dynamics related to oak decline. The Landsat TM image in 1992 and the ETM+ image in 2000 were processed to calculate the differential NDWI which revealed moisture variation primarily caused by the drought and the associated red oak borers. A simple thresholding method was used to map oak dying back, recovery and non-change areas in the study area. The died-back areas were extracted from the modified land use/land cover maps created by the Missouri Resource Assessment Partnership (MoRAP). The forest dynamics map was compared with the online FIA database in which tree species at randomly selected sites were recorded in 1989 and 2003. The overall accuracy of forest dynamics mapping with remote sensing imagery was 75.95\%. The user's accuracy of dying/recovery area mapping was also high although the producer's accuracy is questionable because of the limitation in ground data collection. The continuous dying/recovery map in this study could provide valuable information on the prediction of oak decline and evaluation of damage when another period of environmental stresses occurs.},

The ground-based measurements of LST at Gaize (32.30 degrees N, 84.06 degrees E, 4420 m) on the western Tibetan Plateau from January 2001 to December 2002 agree well (mean and standard deviation of differences of 0.27K and 0.84 K) with the 1-km Version 004 (V4) Terra MODIS LST product (MOD11A1) generated by the split-window algorithm. Spectral emissivities measured from surface soil samples collected at and around the Gaize site are in close agreement with the landcover-based emissivities in bands 31 and 32 used by the split-window algorithm. The LSTs in the V4 MODIS LST/ emissivity products (MYD11B1 for Aqua and MOD11B1 for Terra) from the day/ night LST algorithm are higher by 1-1.7K (standard deviation around 0.6 K) in comparisons to the 5-km grid aggregated values of the LSTs in the 1-km products, which is consistent with the results of a comparison of emissivities. On average, the emissivity in MYD11B1 (MOD11B1) is 0.0107 (0.0167) less than the ground-based measurements, which is equivalent to a 0.64K (1.25 K) overestimation of LST around the average value of 285 K. Knowledge obtained from the evaluation of MODIS LST/ emissivity retrievals provides useful information for the improvement of the MODIS LST day/night algorithm. Improved performance of the refined (V5) day/night algorithm was demonstrated with the Terra MODIS data in May-June 2004.},

Hence a water shortage assessment model was developed based on the variable fuzzy set, which reasonably identifies the relative membership degree and function of simple index and standard interval of each level. The model is used to assess water shortage risks in the Yangtze River Delta (which comprises the cities of Shanghai and Nanjing) and in the Capital-area of China (including the cities of Beijing and Tianjin). Results show that the proposed model rationally determines the membership grade in the range of rankings for all related indicators. More importantly, the proposed model is flexible and adaptable for diagnosing water shortage risks for different ecological conditions.}

A main cause is the deep disparities in access to care and health outcomes. Federal programs such as the designations of Medically Underserved Areas/Populations and Health Professional Shortage Areas are designed to boost the number of health professionals serving these areas and to help alleviate the access problem. Their effectiveness relies first and foremost on an accurate measure of accessibility so that resources can be allocated to truly needy areas. Various measures of accessibility need to be integrated into one framework for comparison and evaluation. Optimization methods can be used to improve the distribution and supply of health care providers to maximize service coverage, minimize travel needs of patients, limit the number of facilities, and maximize health or access equality. Inequality in health care access comes at a personal and societal price, evidenced in disparities in health outcomes, including late-stage cancer diagnosis. This review surveys recent literature on the three named issues with emphasis on methodological advancements and implications for public policy.}

The factors associated with the SUHII were assessed by considering a variety of related social, economic and natural factors using a regression tree model. Obvious seasonal variation was observed for the daytime SUHII, and the diurnal variation in SUHII varied seasonally across China. Interestingly, the SUHII varied significantly in character between northern and southern China. Southern China experienced more intense daytime SUHIIs, while the opposite was true for nighttime SUHIIs. Vegetation had the greatest effect in the day time in northern China. In southern China, annual electricity consumption and the number of public buses were found to be important. These results have important theoretical significance and may be of use to mitigate UHI effects.},

The experiment was designed to generate a dataset to describe the behavior of gaseous plumes under low-wind conditions and the ability of current, commonly used models to predict these movements. The dataset documents the release and transport of three gases: ammonia (buoyant), ethylene (neutral), and propylene (dense) in low-wind speed (diffusion) conditions. Release rates ranged from 1 to 20 kg h¡sup¿−1¡/sup¿. Ammonia and ethylene had five 5-min releases each to represent puff releases and five 20-min releases each to represent plume releases. Propylene had five 5-min puffs, six 20-min plumes, and a single 30-min plume. Thirty-two separate releases ranging from 6 to 47 min were conducted, of which only 30 releases generated useful data. The data collected included release rates, atmospheric concentrations to 100 m from the release point, and local meteorological conditions. The diagnostics included nine meteorological stations on 100-m centers and 36 photoionization detectors in a radial pattern. Three current state-of-the-practice models, Aerial Locations of Hazardous Atmospheres (ALOHA), Emergency Prediction Information code (EPIcode), and Second-Order Closure Integrated Puff (SCIPUFF), were used to try to duplicate the measured field results. Low wind speeds are difficult to model, and all of the models had difficulty replicating the field measurements. However, the work does show that these models, if used correctly, are conservative (overpredict concentrations) and can be used for safety and emergency planning.},

These, together with Roujean et al.'s (1992) approximation to Ross' theory for large LAI and their geometric-optical model of rectangular protrusions, may be used for formulating semiempirical models of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) of the land surface through linear combinations. Because the functions superimposed depend only on viewing and illumination geometry, the BRDF models derived may be called kemel-driven; but Nilson and Kuusk's (1989) modified version of Walthall et al.'s (1985) model is an example of an empirical model that belongs to this same class. The linearity of kemel-driven models is advantageous to global BRDF and albedo processing needs in several respects, most notably analytical invertibility, making possible look-up table approaches to albedo calculation, accommodation of mixed pixel situations, and spatial scaling. The models discussed here are being proposed for BRDF/albedo processing for the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor of NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS).},

The purpose is to determine if existing lidar data flown in leaf-off conditions for applications such as terrain mapping can effectively estimate forested riparian buffer H and FC within a range of riparian vegetation types. illustrate that: 1) leaf-off and leaf-on lidar percentile estimates are similar to measured heights in all plots except those dominated by deciduous compound-leaved trees where lidar underestimates H during leaf off periods; 2) canopy height models (CHMs) underestimate H by a larger margin compared to percentile methods and are influenced by vegetation type (conifer needle, deciduous simple leaf or deciduous compound leaf) and canopy height variability, 3) lidar estimates of FC are within 10\% of plot measurements during leaf-on periods, but are underestimated during leaf-off periods except in mixed and conifer plots; and 4) depth of laser pulse penetration lower in the canopy is more variable compared to top of the canopy penetration which may influence within canopy vegetation structure estimates. This study demonstrates that leaf-off lidar data can be used to estimate forested riparian buffer canopy height within diverse vegetation conditions and fractional canopy cover within mixed and conifer forests when leaf-on lidar data are not available.}

  abstract = {Remote sensing image classification has proven to be attractive for extracting useful thematic information such as land-cover. However, often for a given application, spectral information acquired by a remote sensing sensor may not be sufficient to derive accurate information. Incorporation of data from other sources such as a digital elevation model (DEM), and geophysical and geological data may assist in achieving more accurate land-cover classification from remote sensing images. Recently, support vector machines (SVM) have been proposed as an alternative for classification of remote sensing data, and the results are promising. In this paper, we employ the SVM algorithm to perform multisource classification. An IRS-1C Liss III image along with normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) image and DEM are used to produce a land-cover classification for a region in the Himalayas. The accuracy of SVM-based multisource classification is compared with several other non-parametric algorithms namely a decision tree classifier, and back propagation and radial basis function neural network classifiers. The well-known kappa coefficient of agreement is used to assess classification accuracy. The differences in the kappa coefficient of classifiers have been statistically evaluated using a pairwise Z-test. The results show a significant increase in the accuracy of the SVM based classifier on incorporation of ancillary data over classification performed solely on the basis of spectral data from remote sensing sensors.},

An influx of carrion crows (Corvus corone), generalist predators, followed the development. On the most developed area near the main car park, ptarmigan occurred at high density but then lost nests to frequent crows, reared abnormally few broods, died flying into ski-lift wires and declined until none bred for many summers. On a nearby higher area with fewer wires, ptarmigan lost nests to frequent crows and reared abnormally few broods, but seldom died on wires. Adult numbers declined and then became unusually steady for over two decades, with no significant cycle. On a third area further from the car park, ptarmigan lost fewer nests to the less frequent crows but bred more poorly than in the massif's centre, and showed cycles of lower amplitude than there. On a fourth area yet further away, with few or no crows, ptarmigan bred as well as in the massif's centre and showed cycles of the same amplitude as there.},

This linkage is possible because both studies share land-use and landcover data. Landsat Thematic Mapper data are utilized to detect urban land-cover changes. GIS analyses are then conducted to examine the changing spatial patterns of urban growth. The integration of remote sensing and GIS is applied to automate the estimation of surface runoff based on the Soil Conservation Service model. Impacts of urban growth on surface runoff and the rainfall–runoff relationship are examined by linking the two modeling results with spatial analysis techniques. This methodology is applied to the Zhujiang Delta of southern China, where dramatic urban growth has occurred over the past two decades, and the rampant urban growth has created severe problems in water resources management. The results revealed a notably uneven spatial pattern of urban growth and an increase of 8.10 mm in annual runoff depth during the 1989–1997 period. An area that experienced more urban growth had a greater potential for increasing annual surface runoff. Highly urbanized areas were more prone to flooding. Urbanization lowered potential maximum storage, and thus increased runoff coefficient values.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

This paper examines current practices, problems, and prospects in this particular field of study. The emphasis is placed in the summarization of methods, techniques, and applications of remotely sensed TIR data used in urban studies. In addition, some future research directions are outlined. This literature review suggests that the majority of previous research have focused on LST patterns and their relationships with urban surface biophysical characteristics, especially with vegetation indices and land use/cover types. Less attention has been paid to the derivation of UHI parameters from LST data and to the use of remote sensing techniques to estimate surface energy fluxes. Major recent advances include application of sub-pixel quantitative surface descriptors in examining LST patterns and dynamics, derivation of key UHI parameters based on parametric and non-parametric models, and integration of remotely sensed variables with in situ meteorological data for urban surface energy modeling. More research is needed in order to define better "urban surface" from the remote sensing viewpoint, to examine measurement and modeling scales, and to differentiate modeled and measured fluxes. ?? 2009 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

  abstract = {The knowledge of impervious surfaces, especially the magnitude, location, geometry, spatial pattern of impervious surfaces and the perviousness-imperviousness ratio, is significant to a range of issues and themes in environmental science central to global environmental change and human-environment interactions. Impervious surface data is important for urban planning and environmental and resources management. Therefore, remote sensing of impervious surfaces in the urban areas has recently attracted unprecedented attention. In this paper, various digital remote sensing approaches to extract and estimate impervious surfaces will be examined. Discussions will focus on the mapping requirements of urban impervious surfaces. In particular, the impacts of spatial, geometric, spectral, and temporal resolutions on the estimation and mapping will be addressed, so will be the selection of an appropriate estimation method based on remotely sensed data characteristics. This literature review suggests that major approaches over the past decade include pixel-based (image classification, regression, etc.), sub-pixel based (linear spectral unmixing, imperviousness as the complement of vegetation fraction etc.), object-oriented algorithms, and artificial neural networks. Techniques, such as data/image fusion, expert systems, and contextual classification methods, have also been explored. The majority of research efforts have been made for mapping urban landscapes at various scales and on the spatial resolution requirements of such mapping. In contrast, there is less interest in spectral and geometric properties of impervious surfaces. More researches are also needed to better understand temporal resolution, change and evolution of impervious surfaces over time, and temporal requirements for urban mapping. It is suggested that the models, methods, and image analysis algorithms in urban remote sensing have been largely developed for the imagery of medium resolution (10-100. m). The advent of high spatial resolution satellite images, spaceborne hyperspectral images, and LiDAR data is stimulating new research idea, and is driving the future research trends with new models and algorithms. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The GIS market is growing rapidly and as a Python developer you will find yourself either wanting grounding in GIS or needing to get up to speed to do your job. In today's location-aware world, all commercial Python developers can benefit from an understanding of GIS development gained using this book.Working with geo-spatial data can get complicated because you are dealing with mathematical models of the Earth's surface. Since Python is a powerful programming language with high-level toolkits, it is well suited to GIS development. will familiarize you with the Python tools required for geo-spatial development such as Mapnik, which is used for mapping in Python. It introduces GIS at the basic level with a clear, detailed walkthrough of the key GIS concepts such as location, distance, units, projections, datums, and GIS data formats. We then examine a number of Python libraries and combine these with geo-spatial data to accomplish a variety of tasks. The book provides an in-depth look at the concept of storing spatial data in a database and how you can use spatial databases as tools to solve a variety of geo-spatial problems.It goes into the details of generating maps using the Mapnik map-rendering toolkit, and helps you to build a sophisticated web-based geo-spatial map-editing application using GeoDjango, Mapnik, and PostGIS. By the end of the book, you will be able to integrate spatial features into your applications and build a complete mapping application from scratch.A hands-on tutorial about accessing, manipulating, and displaying Geo-Spatial data efficiently using a range of Python tools for GIS development},

  abstract = {The wildland–urban interface (WUI) is the region where development meets and intermingles with wildlands. The WUI has an elevated fire risk due to the proximity of development and residents to wildlands with natural wildfire regimes. Existing methods of delineating WUI are typically applied over a large region, use proxies for risk, and do not consider site-specific fire hazard drivers. While these models are appropriate for federal and provincial risk management, municipal managers require models intended for smaller regions. The model developed here uses the Burn-P3 fire behavior model to model WUI from local fire susceptibility (FS) in two study communities. Forest fuel code (FFC) maps for the study communities were modified using remote sensing data to produce detailed forest edges, including ladder fuels, update data currency, and add buildings and roads. The modified FFC maps used in Burn-P3 produced bimodal FS distributions for each community. The WUI in these communities was delineated as areas within community bounds where FS was greater than or equal to −1 SD from the mean FS value ( WUI=FS⩾−1[χ¯−σ]WUI = FS ⩾- 1 \, [χ̄- σ] ), which fell in the trough of the bimodal distribution. The WUI so delineated conformed to the definition of WUI. This model extends WUI modeling for broader risk management initiatives for municipal management of risk, as it (a) considers site-specific drivers of fire behavior; (b) models risk, represented by WUI, specific to a community; and, (c) does not use proxies for risk.},

  abstract = {We propose an integrated approach to estimating building inventory for seismic vulnerability assessment, which can be applied to different urban environments and be efficiently scaled depending on the desired level of detail. The approach employs a novel multi-source method for evaluating structural vulnerability-related building features based on satellite remote sensing and ground-based omnidirectional imaging. It aims to provide a comparatively cost- and time-efficient way of inventory data capturing over large areas. The latest image processing algorithms and computer vision techniques are used on multiple imaging sources within the framework of an integrated sampling scheme, where each imaging source and technique is used to infer specific, scale-dependent information. Globally available low-cost data sources are preferred and the tools are being developed on an open-source basis to allow for a high degree of transferability and usability. An easily deployable omnidirectional camera-system is introduced for ground-based data-capturing. After a general description of the approach and the developed tools and techniques, preliminary results from a first application to our study area, Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, are presented.}

  abstract = {In the United States, there is widespread concern about understanding and curbing urban sprawl, which has been cited for its negative impacts on natural resources, economic health, and community character. There is not, however, a universally accepted definition of urban sprawl. It has been described using quantitative measures, qualitative terms, attitudinal explanations, and landscape patterns. To help local, regional and state land use planners better understand and address the issues attributed to sprawl, researchers at NASA's Northeast Regional Earth Science Applications Center (RESAC) at The University of Connecticut have developed an urban growth model. The model, which is based on land cover derived from remotely sensed satellite imagery, determines the geographic extent, patterns, and classes of urban growth over time. Input data to the urban growth model consist of two dates of satellite-derived land cover data that are converted, based on user-defined reclassification options, to just three classes: developed, non-developed, and water. The model identifies three classes of undeveloped land as well as developed land for both dates based on neighborhood information. These two images are used to create a change map that provides more detail than a traditional change analysis by utilizing the classes of non-developed land and including contextual information. The change map becomes the input for the urban growth analysis where five classes of growth are identified: infill, expansion, isolated, linear branch, and clustered branch. The output urban growth map is a powerful visual and quantitative assessment of the kinds of urban growth that have occurred across a landscape. Urban growth further can be characterized using a temporal sequence of urban growth maps to illustrate urban growth dynamics. Beyond analysis, the ability of remote sensing-based information to show changes to a community's landscape, at different geographic scales and over time, is a new and unique resource for local land use decision makers as they plan the future of their communities. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are being used in a growing number of application areas. As a consequence there have been frequent calls to expand the range of spatial analysis tools available to users of GIS but a reluctance on the part of GIS software vendors to include such tools in standard software packages. An alternative approach is to link extra tools to GIS packages which raises a series of issues, such as, What sort of tools should be included? How should the linkage be done? To what extent can the functionality of the GIS be used? This paper draws on the results of a project in which software for statistical spatial data analysis (SSDA) was linked to ARC/INFO to produce a software system called SAGE. The statistical tools implemented included those which were felt to be useful to the general GIS user (as opposed to the specialist spatial statistician or econometrician), and they were linked to ARC/INFO using a client server architecture. The GIS was used within the context of SSDA for map drawing, spatial queries and operations on the topology of the spatial data, although it was found that the map drawing facilities of ARC/INFO were not well suited to the needs of this application. One of the conclusions of the project was that many of the techniques of exploratory spatial data analysis, such as providing graphical data summaries and linking these to cartographic views of the data could be easily integrated into existing GIS packages, providing a useful addition to their functionality for many GIS users. Many of the other SSDA facilities are probably still best provided in specialist software, but there is a need for a robust and standardised means for such software to extract information about the topology of spatial data from within GIS packages.}

  abstract = {Medical and health researchers have shown that fatalities during heat waves are most commonly due to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, primarily from heat's negative effect on the cardiovascular system. In an attempt to control one's internal temperature, the body's natural instinct is to circulate large quantities of blood to the skin. However, to perform this protective measure against overheating actually harms the body by inducing extra strain on the heart. This excess strain has the potential to trigger a cardiac event in those with chronic health problems, such as the elderly, Cui et al. Frumkin showed that the relationship of mortality and temperature creates a J-shaped function, showing a steeper slope at higher temperatures. Records show that more casualties have resulted from heat waves than hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes together. This statistic's significance is that extreme heat events (EHEs) are becoming more frequent, as shown by Stone et al. Their analysis shows a growth trend of EHEs by 0.20 days/year in U.S. cities between 1956 and 2005, with a 95\% confidence interval and uncertainty of ±0.6. This means that there were 10 more days of extreme heat conditions in 2005 than in 1956. Studies held from 1989 to 2000 in 50 U.S. cities recorded a rise of 5.7\% in mortality during heat waves. The research of Schifano et al. revealed that Rome's elderly population endures a higher mortality rate during heat waves, at 8\% excess for the 65–74 age group and 15\% for above 74. Even more staggering is findings of Dousset et al. on French cities during the 2003 heat wave. Small towns saw an average excess mortality rate of 40\%, while Paris witnessed an increase of 141\%. During this period, a 0.5 °C increase above the average minimum nighttime temperature doubled the risk of death in the elderly. Heat-related illnesses and mortality rates have slightly decreased since 1980, regardless of the increase in temperatures. Statistics from the U.S. Census state that the U.S. population without air conditioning saw a drop of 32\% from 1978 to 2005, resting at 15\%. Despite the increase in air conditioning use, a study done by Kalkstein through 2007 proved that the shielding effects of air conditioning reached their terminal effect in the mid-1990s. Kan et al. hypothesize in their study of Shanghai that the significant difference in fatalities from the 1998 and 2003 heat waves was due to the increase in use of air conditioning. Protective factors have mitigated the danger of heat on those vulnerable to it, however projecting forward the heat increment related to sprawl may exceed physiologic adaptation thresholds. It has been studied and reported that urban heat islands (UHI) exist in the following world cities and their countries and/or states: Tel-Aviv, Israel, Newark, NJ, Madrid, Spain, London, UK, Athens, Greece, Taipei, Taiwan, San Juan, Puerto Rico, Osaka, Japan, Hong Kong, China, Beijing, China, Pyongyang, North Korea, Bangkok, Thailand, Manila, Philippines, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Seoul, South Korea, Muscat, Oman, Singapore, Houston, USA, Shanghai, China, Wroclaw, Poland, Mexico City, Mexico, Arkansas, Atlanta, USA, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Kenya, Brisbane, Australia, Moscow, Russia, Los Angeles, USA, Washington, DC, USA, San Diego, USA, New York, USA, Chicago, USA, Budapest, Hungary, Miami, USA, Istanbul, Turkey, Mumbai, India, Shenzen, China, Thessaloniki, Greece, Rotterdam, Netherlands, Akure, Nigeria, Bucharest, Romania, Birmingham, UK, Bangladesh, and Delhi, India. The strongest being Shanghai, Bangkok, Beijing, Tel-Aviv, and Tokyo with UHI intensities (UHII) of 3.5–7.0, 3.0–8.0, 5.5–10, 10, and 12 °C, respectively. Of the above world cities, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Delhi, Bangladesh, London, Kyoto, Osaka, and Berlin have been linked to increased mortality rates due to the heightened temperatures of nonheat wave periods. Chan et al. studied excess mortalities in cities such as Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Delhi, which currently observe mortality increases ranging from 4.1\% to 5.8\% per 1 °C over a temperature threshold of approximately 29 °C. Goggins et al. found similar data for the urban area of Bangladesh, which showed an increase of 7.5\% in mortality for every 1 °C the mean temperature was above a similar threshold. In the same study, while observing microregions of Montreal portraying heat island characteristics, mortality was found to be 28\% higher in heat island zones on days with a mean temperature of 26 °C opposed to 20 °C compared to a 13\% increase in colder areas.},

  abstract = {Recent disasters highlight the threat that tsunamis pose to coastal communities. When developing tsunami-education efforts and vertical-evacuation strategies, emergency managers need to understand how much time it could take for a coastal population to reach higher ground before tsunami waves arrive. To improve efforts to model pedestrian evacuations from tsunamis, we examine the sensitivity of least-cost-distance models to variations in modeling approaches, data resolutions, and travel-rate assumptions. We base our observations on the assumption that an anisotropic approach that uses path-distance algorithms and accounts for variations in land cover and directionality in slope is the most realistic of an actual evacuation landscape. We focus our efforts on the Long Beach Peninsula in Washington (USA), where a substantial residential and tourist population is threatened by near-field tsunamis related to a potential Cascadia subduction zone earthquake. Results indicate thousands of people are located in areas where evacuations to higher ground will be difficult before arrival of the first tsunami wave. Deviations from anisotropic modeling assumptions substantially influence the amount of time likely needed to reach higher ground. Across the entire study, changes in resolution of elevation data has a greater impact on calculated travel times than changes in land-cover resolution. In particular areas, land-cover resolution had a substantial impact when travel-inhibiting waterways were not reflected in small-scale data. Changes in travel-speed parameters had a substantial impact also, suggesting the importance of public-health campaigns as a tsunami risk-reduction strategy.},

  abstract = {A methodology for using remotely sensed data to both generate and evaluate a hydraulic model of floodplain inundation is presented for a rural case study in the United Kingdom: Upton-upon-Severn. Remotely sensed data have been processed and assembled to provide an excellent test data set for both model construction and validation. In order to assess the usefulness of the data and the issues encountered in its use, two models for floodplain inundation were constructed: one based on an industry standard one-dimensional approach and the other based on a simple two-dimensional approach. The results and their implications for the future use of remotely sensed data for predicting flood inundation are discussed. Key conclusions for the use of remotely sensed data are that care must be taken to integrate different data sources for both model construction and validation and that improvements in ground height data shift the focus in terms of model uncertainties to other sources such as boundary conditions. The differences between the two models are found to be of minor significance.}

  abstract = {The objective of this study was to quantify sample transportation times associated with mandated microbiological monitoring of drinking-water in Colombia. World Health Organization Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality recommend that samples spend no more than 6 h between collection and analysis in a laboratory. Census data were used to estimate the minimum number of operational and surveillance samples required from piped water supplies under national regulations. Drive-times were then computed from each supply system to the nearest accredited laboratory and translated into sample holding times based on likely daily monitoring patterns. Of 62,502 surveillance samples required annually, 5694 (9.1\%) were found to be more than 6 h from the nearest of 278 accredited laboratories. 612 samples (1.0\%) were more than 24 hours' drive from the nearest accredited laboratory, the maximum sample holding time recommended by the World Health Organization. An estimated 30\% of required rural samples would have to be stored for more than 6 h before reaching a laboratory. The analysis demonstrates the difficulty of undertaking microbiological monitoring in rural areas and small towns from a fixed laboratory network. Our GIS-based approach could be adapted to optimise monitoring strategies and support planning of testing and transportation infra-structure development. It could also be used to estimate sample transport and holding times in other countries.},

To quantitatively determine urban land use extents and development densities, sub-pixel impervious surface areas were mapped for both areas. The urban-rural boundaries and urban development densities were defined by selecting certain imperviousness threshold values and Landsat thermal bands were used to investigate urban surface thermal patterns. Analysis results suggest that urban surface thermal characteristics and patterns can be identified through qualitatively based urban land use and development density data. Results show the urban area of the Tampa Bay watershed has a daytime heating effect (heat-source), whereas the urban surface in Las Vegas has a daytime cooling effect (heat-sink). These thermal effects strongly correlated with urban development densities where higher percent imperviousness is usually associated with higher surface temperature. Using vegetation canopy coverage information, the spatial and temporal distributions of urban impervious surface and associated thermal characteristics are demonstrated to be very useful sources in quantifying urban land use, development intensity, and urban thermal patterns. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

NLCD 2001 is widely used as a baseline for national land cover and impervious cover conditions. To enable the updating of this database in an optimal manner, methods are designed to be accomplished by individual Landsat scene. Using conservative change thresholds based on land cover classes, areas of change and no-change were segregated from change vectors calculated from normalized Landsat scenes from 2001 and 2006. By sampling from NLCD 2001 impervious surface in unchanged areas, impervious surface predictions were estimated for changed areas within an urban extent defined by a companion land cover classification. Methods were developed and tested for national application across six study sites containing a variety of urban impervious surface. Results show the vast majority of impervious surface change associated with urban development was captured, with overall RMSE from 6.86 to 13.12\% for these areas. Changes of urban development density were also evaluated by characterizing the categories of change by percentile for impervious surface. This prototype method provides a relatively low cost, flexible approach to generate updated impervious surface using NLCD 2001 as the baseline. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Aims Mapping vegetation through remotely sensed images involves various considerations, processes and techniques. Increasing availability of remotely sensed images due to the rapid advancement of remote sensing technology expands the horizon of our choices of imagery sources. Various sources of imagery are known for their differences in spectral, spatial, radioactive and temporal characteristics and thus are suitable for different purposes of vegetation mapping. Generally, it needs to develop a vegetation classification at first for classifying and mapping vegetation cover from remote sensed images either at a community level or species level. Then, correlations of the vegetation types (communities or species) within this classification system with discernible spectral characteristics of remote sensed imagery have to be identified. These spectral classes of the imagery are finally translated into the vegetation types in the image interpretation process, which is also called image processing. This paper presents an overview of how to use remote sensing imagery to classify and map vegetation cover. Methods Specifically, this paper focuses on the comparisons of popular remote sensing sensors, commonly adopted image processing methods and prevailing classification accuracy assessments. Important findings The basic concepts, available imagery sources and classification techniques of remote sensing imagery related to vegetation mapping were introduced, analyzed and compared. The advantages and limitations of using remote sensing imagery for vegetation cover mapping were provided to iterate the importance of thorough understanding of the related concepts and careful design of the technical procedures, which can be utilized to study vegetation cover from remote sensed images.},

The IBI is distinguished from conventional indices by its first-time use of thematic index-derived bands to construct an index rather than by using original image bands. The three thematic indices used in constructing the IBI are the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI). Respectively, these represent the three major urban components of vegetation, water and built-up land. The new index has been verified using the Landsat ETM+ image of Fuzhou City in southeastern China. The result shows that the IBI can significantly enhance the built-up land feature while effectively suppressing background noise. A statistical analysis indicates that the IBI possesses a positive correlation with land surface temperature, but negative correlations with the NDVI and the MNDWI.},

  abstract = {Worldwide urbanization has accelerated expansion of urban built-up lands and resulted in substantial negative impacts on the global environments. Precisely measuring the urban sprawl is becoming an increasing need. Among the satellite-based earth observation systems, the Landsat and ASTER data are most suitable for mesoscale measurements of urban changes. Nevertheless, to date the difference in the capability of mapping built-up land between the two sensors is not clear. Therefore, this study compared the performances of the Landsat-7 ETM+ and ASTER sensors for built-up land mapping in the coastal areas of southeastern China. The comparison was implemented on three date-coincident image pairs and achieved by using three approaches, including per-band-based, index-based, and classification-based comparisons. The index used is the Index-based Built-up Index (IBI), while the classification algorithm employed is the Support Vector Machine (SVM). Results show that in the study areas, ETM+ and ASTER have an overall similar performance in built-up land mapping but also differ in several aspects. The IBI values determined from ASTER were consistently higher than from ETM+ by up to 45.54\% according to percentage difference. The ASTER also estimates more built-up land area than ETM+ by 5.9-6.3\% estimated with the IBI-based approach or 3.9-6.1\% with the SVM classification. The differences in the spectral response functions and spatial resolution between relative spectral bands of the two sensors are attributed to these different performances. ?? 2013 COSPAR.

  abstract = {The spectral properties and surface temperature of land cover influences the urban environmental conditions. This research takes the Nanjing city in Jiangsu Province of China as a case. The urban reflectance is grouped into three types (substrate, vegetation and water) by linear spectral mixture. The substrate surface in Nanjing is expanding from the central urban area to the suburbs during, but the intensity of substrate surface in the central urban has weakened since 2007. The land surface temperature mainly has negative relation with vegetation surface at the rate of Y=-X and Y=-2.5X. There is mainly positive relation between land surface temperature and substrate surface at the rate as Y=X and Y=2.5X. The land surface temperature has mainly negative relation with dark surface at the rate of Y=-3X. Some abnormal phenomenon is caused by the mixed pixels and moisture soil. At the same time, the intensity of land surface temperature also influences the population number and precipitation as the equator of Y=4.2503X+590.7 and y=2.3811x+14.986. The linear quantitative relation between land surface temperature and vegetation, substrate and dark surface are potential to apply for ecologic, hydrologic and climate models and for a reasonable land planning.},

Geography is rapidly changing by the impact of external factors on geographical research and also as a consequence of economic recession and cutbacks in higher education. Most geography departments in universities have tried to approach this impact by promoting or shifting to human geography as an applied science, and by offering relevant skills through GIS as an approach to contemporary problems. It is concluded that quantitative geography is essential for the further expansion of GIS within geography and also for the survival of geography.},

First, it helps to obtain reliable estimates of seismic hazards and losses soon after occurrence of large earthquakes. Second, it helps to simulate earthquake scenarios and to provide useful estimates for local governments or public services to propose their seismic disaster mitigation plans. Third, it helps to provide catastrophic risk management tools, such as proposing the seismic insurance policy for residential buildings.

  abstract = {This paper demonstrates the applicability of small footprint, high sampling density airborne laser scanners for boreal forest change detection, i.e. the estimation of forest growth and monitoring of harvested trees. Two laser acquisitions were carried out on a test site using a Toposys-1 laser scanner. Three-dimensional canopy height models were calculated for both data sets using raster-based algorithms. Object-oriented algorithms were developed for detecting harvested and fallen trees, and for measuring forest growth at plot and stand levels. Out of 83 field-checked harvested trees, 61 could be automatically and correctly detected. All mature harvested trees were detected; it was mainly the smaller trees that were not. Forest growth was demonstrated at plot and stand levels using an object-oriented tree-to-tree matching algorithm and statistical analysis. The precision of the estimated growth, based on field checking or statistical analysis, was about 5 cm at stand level and about 10–15 cm at plot level. The authors expect that the methods may be feasible in large area forest inventories that make use of permanent sample plots. Together with methods for detecting individual sample trees, the methods described may be used to replace a large number of permanent plots with laser scanning techniques.}

Recently, concern has arisen about whether this relationship is modified by socio-demographic factors. However, data for this type of study is relatively scarce in subtropical/tropical regions where people are well accustomed to warm temperatures. Objective: To investigate whether the relationship between daily mean temperature and daily all-cause mortality is modified by age, gender and socio-economic status (SES) in Brisbane, Australia. Methods: We obtained daily mean temperature and all-cause mortality data for Brisbane, Australia during 1996-2004. A generalised additive model was fitted to assess the percentage increase in all deaths with every one degree increment above the threshold temperature. Different age, gender and SES groups were included in the model as categorical variables and their modification effects were estimated separately. Results: A total of 53,316 non-external deaths were included during the study period. There was a clear increasing trend in the harmful effect of high temperature on mortality with age. The effect estimate among women was more than 20 times that among men. We did not find an SES effect on the percent increase associated with temperature. Conclusions: The effects of high temperature on all deaths were modified by age and gender but not by SES in Brisbane, Australia. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters in the physics of earth surface processes from local to global scales. The importance of LST is being increasingly recognized and there is a strong interest in developing methodologies to measure LST from the space. Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) is the newest thermal infrared sensor for the Landsat project, providing two adjacent thermal bands, which has a great benefit for the LST inversion. In this paper, we compared three different approaches for LST inversion from TIRS, including the radiative transfer equation-based method, the split-window algorithm and the single channel method. Four selected energy balance monitoring sites from the Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) were used for validation, combining with the MODIS 8 day emissivity product. For the investigated sites and scenes, results show that the LST inverted from the radiative transfer equation-based method using band 10 has the highest accuracy with RMSE lower than 1 K, while the SW algorithm has moderate accuracy and the SC method has the lowest accuracy.},

Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) data were used to estimate the LST from four different seasons for the Twin Cities, Minnesota, metropolitan area. A map of percent impervious surface with a standard error of 7.95\% was generated using a normalized spectral mixture analysis of July 2002 Landsat TM imagery. Our analysis indicates there is a strong linear relationship between LST and percent impervious surface for all seasons, whereas the relationship between LST and NDVI is much less strong and varies by season. This result suggests percent impervious surface provides a complementary metric to the traditionally applied NDVI for analyzing LST quantitatively over the seasons for surface urban heat island studies using thermal infrared remote sensing in an urbanized environment. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {In order to test the veracity of currently accepted ideas about Northern Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) habitat associations in the Klamath Province of northern California (USA) we compared different habitat descriptions using predictive habitat-association models. The current description used by federal agencies and new descriptions based on research results and field biologists' best estimates of owl nesting/roosting habitat and foraging habitat were evaluated. For each habitat description, three habitat metrics and three forms of the relationship between owl occupancy and quantities of these habitat metrics were evaluated, each at three spatial scales. Our refined descriptions of owl nesting and roosting, and foraging habitat, were better at predicting owl occupancy than the habitat description currently used by federal land managers. The best-fitting model for predicting owl occupancy was at the 200-ha scale and exhibited a pseudo-threshold relationship to nesting and roosting habitat and a quadratic relationship to foraging habitat. This model correctly classified owl-occupied sites 94\% of the time for the developmental data set and between 85\% and 92\% of the time on four independent test data sets. The current description of owl habitat in northern California ranked among the worst in the collection of models we examined. The testing of multiple models on the four independent data sets was very important for determining the goodness-of-fit and predictive capabilities of the best models. We explored the use of the best-fitting model to predict number of owls on several independent study areas and found a strong correlation between predicted and observed number of owls. The results of this study are beginning to be used to make land-management decisions regarding harvesting and prescribed-burning activities on federal forestlands and were specifically designed to be amenable to adaptive resource management.},

It is a lengthy process to convert satellite imagery into land cover map using the existing methods of manual interpretation and parametric image classification digitally. In this paper we propose a new method based on Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) to automate the process of mapping built-up areas. It takes advantage of the unique spectral response of built-up areas and other land covers. Built-up areas are effectively mapped through arithmetic manipulation of re-coded Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and NDBI images derived from TM imagery. The devised NDBI method was applied to map urban land in the city of Nanjing, eastern China. The mapped results at an accuracy of 92.6\% indicate that it can be used to fulfil the mapping objective reliably. Compared with the maximum likelihood classification method, the proposed NDBI is able to serve as a worthwhile alternative for quickly and objectively mapping built-up areas.},

  abstract = {Relative radiometric normalization among multiple remotely sensed images is an important step of preprocessing for applications such as change detection and image mosaicking. In this paper we present a new automatic normalization approach that uses the iteratively weighted least square regression technique. This approach does not require selection of the pseudo‐invariant features beforehand as in some other traditional methods, and is robust to outliers since it adaptively places different weights on different pixels according to their probabilities of no‐change. This approach is mainly applicable to cases where primary spectral differences between the two images are caused by variations in imaging conditions rather than phenological cycle or land cover changes. The effectiveness of this approach was demonstrated by two experiments using both artificially constructed data and remotely sensed images respectively. The experimental result seems promising and our approach shows accuracy comparable to normalization methods.}

  abstract = {Using time series Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery and demographic data of Shanghai for 1997 and 2008, the relationship between land use/land cover (LULC) change and population shift and their effects on the spatiotemporal patterns of urban heat islands (UHIs) were quantitatively examined using an integrated approach of remote sensing, geographical information systems (GIS), and statistical analysis. The results showed that this city has experienced unprecedented urban growth and sprawl during the study period. The developed land increased by 219.50\%, approximately 72.52\% of which was converted from former cropland (24.79\%), fallow land (21.21\%), forest and shrub (18.97\%), bare land (6.62\%), and water (0.93\%). Furthermore, in combination with the detection of LULC change, an analysis of the spatially differential growth rates for developed land area and population size revealed an urban-suburban-exurban gradient pattern of population shifting, as evidenced by a sharp increase in developed land area within the middle sub-zones at the urban fringe and the exurban sub-zones beyond the outer traffic ring. Consequently, changes in LULC and population shifts resulted in significant variation in the spatiotemporal patterns of the UHIs due to the loss of water bodies and vegetated surfaces. In the foreseeable future, substantial population growth and urban expansion will continue, especially in the rapidly urbanizing suburban and exurban areas, and thus, the extent and magnitude of UHI effects will continue expanding as well. The relationships between land use, the UHI effect, and regional climate change require that the underlying mechanisms, patterns, and processes of land conversion as well as the response of urban climate should be addressed throughout official decision-making processes. Thus, the planners and decision-makers could fully evaluate the environmental consequences of different land development scenarios and therefore improve the scientific basis of future planning and regulations. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {The digital elevation model (DEM) produced by the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) has provided important fundamental data for topographic analysis in many fields. The recently released global digital elevation model (GDEM) produced by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) has higher spatial resolution and wider coverage than the SRTM3 DEM, and thus may be of more value to researchers. Taking two typical study areas—the Loess Plateau and the North China Plain of China—as an example, this article assesses the accuracy of the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM by collecting ground control points from topographical maps. It is found that both the SRTM3 DEM and the ASTER GDEM are far more accurate for the North China Plain than for the Loess Plateau. For the Loess Plateau, the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM is similar to that of the SRTM3 DEM; whereas for the North China Plain, it is much worse than that of the SRTM3 DEM. Considering the negative bias of the ASTER GDEM for flat or gentle regions, we improve its accuracy by adding the difference of the mean value between the SRTM3 DEM and ASTER GDEM for the North China Plain; then, the root mean square error (RMSE) of ±7.95 m from the original ASTER GDEM is improved to ±5.26 m, which demonstrates that it is a simple but useful way to improve the accuracy of the ASTER GDEM in flat or gentle regions.}

  abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), a common phenomenon in which surface temperatures are higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas, represents one of the most significant human-induced changes to Earth's surface climate1, 2. Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population3. A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity4 (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, ΔT). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of ΔT (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime ΔT are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime ΔT by 3.0 ± 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing ΔT by 1.5 ± 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher ΔT in drier years. These relationships imply that UHIs will exacerbate heatwave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity6, 7 and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation–temperature feedback8. Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing ΔT on large scales9, 10.},

Most previous studies have estimated UHI intensity using outdated urban extent maps to define urban and its surrounding areas, and the impacts of urban boundary expansion have never been quantified. Here, we assess the possible biases in UHI intensity estimates induced by outdated urban boundary maps using MODIS Land surface temperature (LST) data from 2009 to 2011 for China's 32 major cities, in combination with the urban boundaries generated from urban extent maps of the years 2000, 2005 and 2010. Our results suggest that it is critical to use concurrent urban extent and LST maps to estimate UHI at the city and national levels. Specific definition of UHI matters for the direction and magnitude of potential biases in estimating UHI intensity using outdated urban extent maps.},

At the two lower levels, objects were classified into five classes, building, pavement, bare soil, fine textured vegetation and coarse textured vegetation, respectively. The object-oriented classification approach proved to be effective for urban land cover classification. The overall accuracy of the classification was 92.3\%, and the overall Kappa statistic was 0.899. Land cover proportions as well as vegetation characteristics were then summarized by property parcel.

Remote sensing indices were used to quantify land-use types and employed as explanatory variables in LST modelling. The geographically weighted regression (GWR), a location dependent model, was performed to explore the influences of the spatially varied land-use conditions on the LST patterns. Results revealed that rapid urbanisation in Kunming altered the local thermal environment, particularly in increasing the LST in the zone surrounding the urban core. Remote sensing indices demonstrated that water and vegetation played an important role in mitigating the urban heat island effect, while built-up and barren land accounted for the increase in LST. The GWR improved the goodness-of-fit for LST modelling and provided insights into the spatially varied relationship between LST and land-use conditions.},

  abstract = {Describing and quantifying the spatial heterogeneity of land cover in urban systems is crucial for developing an ecological understanding of cities. This paper presents a new approach to quantifying the fine-scale heterogeneity in urban landscapes that capitalizes on the strengths of two commonly used approaches—visual interpretation and object-based image analysis. This new approach integrates the ability of humans to detect pattern with an object-based image analysis that accurately and efficiently quantifies the components that give rise to that pattern. Patches that contain a mix of built and natural land cover features were first delineated through visual interpretation. These patches served as pre-defined boundaries for finer-scale segmentation and classification of within-patch land cover features which were classified using object-based image analysis. Patches were then classified based on the within-patch proportion cover of features. We applied this approach to the Gwynns Falls watershed in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. The object-based classification approach proved to be effective for classifying within-patch land cover features. The overall accuracy of the classification maps of 1999 and 2004 were 92.3\% and 93.7\%, respectively. This exercise demonstrates that by integrating visual interpretation with object-based classification, the fine-scale spatial heterogeneity in urban landscapes and land cover change can be described and quantified in a more efficient and ecologically meaningful way than either purely automated or visual methods alone. This new approach provides a tool that allows us to quantify the structure of the urban landscape including both built and non-built components that will better accommodate ecological research linking system structure to ecological processes.},

  abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a major anthropogenic alteration on Earth environments and its geospatial pattern remains poorly understood over large areas. Using MODIS data from 2003 to 2011, we quantified the diurnal and seasonal surface UHI intensity (SUHII, urban-suburban temperature difference) in China's 32 major cities, and analyzed their spatial variations and possible underlying mechanisms. Results show that the annual mean SUHII varied markedly from 0.01 to 1.87. ??C in the day and 0.35 to 1.95. ??C at night, with a great deal of spatial heterogeneities. Higher SUHIIs for the day and night were observed in the southeastern and northern regions, respectively. Moreover, the SUHII differed greatly by season, characterized by a higher intensity in summer than in winter during the day, and the opposite during the night for most cities. Consequently, whether the daytime SUHII was higher or lower than the nighttime SUHII for a city depends strongly on the geographic location and research period. The SUHII's distribution in the day related closely to vegetation activity and anthropogenic heat releases in summer, and to climate (temperature and precipitation) in winter, while that at night linked tightly to albedo, anthropogenic heat releases, built-up intensity, and climate in both seasons. Overall, we found the overwhelming control of climate on the SUHII's spatial variability, yet the factors included in this study explained a much smaller fraction of the SUHII variations in the day compared to night and in summer relative to winter (day vs. night: 57\% vs. 72\% in summer, and 61\% vs. 90\% in winter, respectively), indicating more complicated mechanisms underlying the distribution of daytime SUHII, particularly in summer. Our results highlight the different diurnal (day and night) and seasonal (summer and winter) SUHII's spatial patterns and driving forces, suggesting various strategies are needed for an effective UHI effect mitigation. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is one major anthropogenic modification to the Earth system that transcends its physical boundary. Using MODIS data from 2003 to 2012, we showed that the UHI effect decayed exponentially toward rural areas for majority of the 32 Chinese cities. We found an obvious urban/rural temperature "cliff", and estimated that the footprint of UHI effect (FP, including urban area) was 2.3 and 3.9 times of urban size for the day and night, respectively, with large spatiotemporal heterogeneities. We further revealed that ignoring the FP may underestimate the UHI intensity in most cases and even alter the direction of UHI estimates for few cities. Our results provide new insights to the characteristics of UHI effect and emphasize the necessity of considering city- and time-specific FP when assessing the urbanization effects on local climate.},

  abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) represents a major anthropogenic modification to the Earth system and its relationship with urban development is poorly understood at a regional scale. Using Aqua MODIS data and Landsat TM/ETM + images, we examined the spatiotemporal trends of the UHI effect (δT, relative to the rural reference) along the urban development intensity (UDI) gradient in 32 major Chinese cities from 2003 to 2012. We found that the daytime and nighttime δT increased significantly (p¡ 0.05, mostly in linear form) along a rising UDI for 27 and 30 out of 32 cities, respectively. More rapid increases were observed in the southeastern and northwestern parts of China in the day and night, respectively. Moreover, the δT trends differed greatly by season and during daytime in particular. The δT increased more rapidly in summer than in winter during the day and the reverse occurred at night for most cities. Inter-annually, the δT increased significantly in about one-third of the cities during both the day and night times from 2003 to 2012, especially in suburban areas (0.25 ¡ UDI ≤ 0.5), with insignificant trends being observed for most of the remaining cities. We also found that the δT patterns along the UDI gradient were largely controlled by local climate-vegetation conditions, while that across years were dominated by human activities. Our results highlight the strong and highly diverse urbanization effects on local climate cross China and offer limitations on how these certain methods should be used to quantify UHI intensity over large areas. Furthermore, the impacts of urbanization on climate are complex, thus future research efforts should focus more toward direct observation and physical-based modeling to make credible predictions of the effects.},

  abstract = {New sensors and new technologies for remotely sensed data acquisition have proven useful for mapping urban environments. In this paper, a new dataset from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) spaceborne sensor was used with support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithms for classification processing. A case study of Beer-Sheva, Israel demonstrates that ASTER data are suitable for urban studies. The classification results also show that the approach based on SVM has high performance in convergence, speed, and accuracy of training and classifying. Field validation shows that the classification is reliable for urban studies with high classification precision and little confusion (88.6\% average overall accuracy and 9.6\% average omission error for 15-m resolution image classification vs. 89.9\% average overall accuracy and 11.2\% average omission error for 30-m resolution image classification). For the 30-m multispectral data, there are only five classes vs. six for the 15-m visible spectrum data. Despite the additional classes retrieved from the visible data, the short-wave infrared (SWIR) data provides the accuracy in differentiating some of the confused classes.},

  abstract = {The support vector machine (SVM) is known for its good performance in two-class classification, but its extension to multiclass classification is still an ongoing research is- sue. In this article, we propose a new approach for classification, called the import vector machine (IVM), which is built on kernel logistic regression (KLR).We show that the IVM not only performs as well as the SVM in two-class classification, but also can naturally be generalized to the multiclass case. Furthermore, the IVM provides an estimate of the underlying probability. Similar to the support points of the SVM, the IVM model uses only a fraction of the training data to index kernel basis functions, typically a much smaller fraction than the SVM. This gives the IVM a potential computational advantage over the SVM},

  abstract = {Urban and peri-urban environments are composed of a wide variety of materials, making land cover classification challenging. The objective of this research is to determine how effectively multi-season Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and single-season Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data can be combined to map 17 land cover categories in the Greater Boston area of, Massachusetts, USA. The key goal of this work is to test the integration of radar and optical data. The contribution of different dimensions of input data to a random forest classifier was evaluated with map accuracy statistics. PALSAR data produced a 30.99\% overall classification accuracy. Higher classification accuracy (72.24\%) was achieved by adding texture variables derived from the PALSAR data. A September Landsat image produced a map accuracy of 77.96\%. The inclusion of Landsat images from other three seasons increased map accuracy to 86.86\% and Landsat derived texture variables further increased the map accuracy to 92.69\%. The highest map accuracy (93.82\%) was achieved by combining Landsat and PALSAR. Though combining PALSAR and Landsat only increased the overall accuracy by 1.1\%, it was a statistically significant increase, whose magnitude was limited by the high accuracy already achieved with Landsat data. Moreover, confusion matrices and land cover maps indicated that most of this increase was from three urban land cover types (low density residential, high density residential, and commercial/industrial). The results demonstrate the value of combining multitemporal Landsat imagery, ALOS PALSAR data, and texture variables for land cover classification in urban and peri-urban environments. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A new algorithm for Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) of land cover using all available Landsat data is developed. It is capable of detecting many kinds of land cover change continuously as new images are collected and providing land cover maps for any given time. A two-step cloud, cloud shadow, and snow masking algorithm is used for eliminating "noisy" observations. A time series model that has components of seasonality, trend, and break estimates surface reflectance and brightness temperature. The time series model is updated dynamically with newly acquired observations. Due to the differences in spectral response for various kinds of land cover change, the CCDC algorithm uses a threshold derived from all seven Landsat bands. When the difference between observed and predicted images exceeds a threshold three consecutive times, a pixel is identified as land surface change. Land cover classification is done after change detection. Coefficients from the time series models and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from model estimation are used as input to the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). We applied the CCDC algorithm to one Landsat scene in New England (WRS Path 12 and Row 31). All available (a total of 519) Landsat images acquired between 1982 and 2011 were used. A random stratified sample design was used for assessing the change detection accuracy, with 250. pixels selected within areas of persistent land cover and 250. pixels selected within areas of change identified by the CCDC algorithm. The accuracy assessment shows that CCDC results were accurate for detecting land surface change, with producer's accuracy of 98\% and user's accuracies of 86\% in the spatial domain and temporal accuracy of 80\%. Land cover reference data were used as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the land cover classification. The land cover map with 16 categories resulting from the CCDC algorithm had an overall accuracy of 90\%. ?? 2014 Elsevier Inc.},
